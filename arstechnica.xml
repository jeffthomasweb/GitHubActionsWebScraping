<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On a sunny morning in December, an 18-wheeler will pull into a truck depot in Palmer, Texas, just south of Dallas. The driver will step out of the cab and help transfer his trailer to a second rig outfitted with powerful sensors.</p>
<p>This second truck will head south on Interstate 45 toward Houston. It will move cautiously, mostly cruising in the right lane at 65 mph despite the 75 mph speed limit.</p>
<p>After three and a half hours, the truck will exit the freeway in Greenpoint, a neighborhood in the north of Houston. It will proceed to a second truck depot, where the trailer will again be transferred to a new rig. A different driver will get in and haul the cargo to its final destination a few miles away.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048055#p3">Read 64 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048055&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Falcon 9 rocket streaked into the black pre-dawn sky above Florida on Tuesday, carrying four people on the most ambitious private human spaceflight to date.</p>
<p>The crew of the Polaris Dawn mission, led by a billionaire pilot named Jared Isaacman, were injected into an orbit intended to reach an apogee of 1,200 km and a perigee of 190 km. They plan to raise Crew Dragon's orbit to an apogee of 1,400 km near the end of the first day of flight.</p>
<p>Shortly after the mission's launch, Isaacman thanked the flight controllers, engineers, and technicians at SpaceX that made the privately funded trip possible. "We wouldn't be on this journey without all 14,000 of you back at SpaceX," he said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048679#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048679&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For a while earlier this summer, it looked like NASA's flagship mission to study Jupiter's icy moon Europa might miss its launch window this year.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/07/nasas-flagship-mission-to-europa-has-a-problem-vulnerability-to-radiation/">engineers raised concerns</a> that transistors installed throughout the spacecraft might be susceptible to damage from radiation, an omnipresent threat for any probe whipping its way around Jupiter. The transistors are embedded in the spacecraft's circuitry and are responsible for approximately 200 unique applications, many of which are critical to keeping the mission operating as it orbits Jupiter and repeatedly zooms by Europa, interrogating the frozen moon with nine science instruments.</p>
<p>The transistors on the Europa Clipper spacecraft are already installed, and removing them for inspections or replacement would delay the mission's launch until late next year. Europa Clipper has a 21-day launch window beginning October 10 to begin its journey into the outer solar system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048668#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048668&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On Friday, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier">announced</a> plans to introduce an open source generative AI tool that will allow game creators to build 3D environments and objects using text prompts, reports <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/06/1103707/roblox-is-launching-a-generative-ai-that-builds-3d-environments-in-a-snap/">MIT Tech Review</a>. The feature, which is still under development, may streamline the process of creating game worlds on the popular online platform, potentially opening up more aspects of game creation to those without extensive 3D design skills.</p>

<p>Roblox has not announced a specific launch date for the new AI tool, which is based on what it calls a "3D foundational model." The company shared a demo video of the tool where a user types, "create a race track," then "make the scenery a desert," and the AI model creates a corresponding model in the proper environment.</p>
<p>The system will also reportedly let users make modifications, such as changing the time of day or swapping out entire landscapes, and Roblox says the multimodal AI model will ultimately accept video and 3D prompts, not just text.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048533#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048533&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, the US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google started in Virginia—this time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/googles-ad-tech-dominance-spurs-more-antitrust-charges-report-says/">challenging the tech giant's ad tech dominance</a>.</p>
<p>The trial comes after Google lost two major cases that proved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">Google had a monopoly in both general search</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">the Android app store</a>. During her opening statement, DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told US District Judge Leonie Brinkema—who will be ruling on the case after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/google-sends-doj-unexpected-check-in-attempt-to-avoid-monopoly-jury-trial/">Google cut a check to avoid a jury trial</a>—that "it’s worth saying the quiet part out loud," AP News<a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-ad-tech-virginia-opening-7a19f525287f782609a5316b1fdb08f0"> reported</a>.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Gun-owning parents who teach their kids how to responsibly handle and shoot a gun are less likely to store those deadly weapons safely, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2823159?guestAccessKey=7930a951-ea18-47e1-a2c7-036ddf5cf7e4">a survey-based study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics</a>.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by gun violence researchers at Rutgers University, analyzed survey responses from 870 gun-owning parents. Of those, the parents who responded that they demonstrated proper handling to their child or teen, had their kid practice safe handling under supervision, and/or taught their kid how to shoot a firearm were more likely than other gun-owning parents to keep at least one gun unsecured—that is, unlocked and loaded. In fact, each of the three responses carried at least double the odds of the parent having an unlocked, loaded gun around, the study found.</p>
<p>The survey responses may seem like a paradox for parents who value safe and responsible gun handling. Previous studies have suggested that safe storage of firearms can <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2733158">reduce the risk of injuries and deaths among children and teens</a>. A 2005 JAMA study, for instance, found <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200330">lower risks of firearm injuries among children and teens</a> when parents securely store their firearms—meaning they kept them locked, unloaded, and stored separately from locked ammunition. And as of 2020, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2201761">firearm-related injuries became the leading cause of death among children and teens</a> in the US.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048347#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048347&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple plans to release the next versions of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/">iOS</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ipados-18-adds-machine-learning-wizardry-with-handwriting-math-features/">iPadOS</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-announces-macos-15-sequoia/">macOS</a>, and watchOS to the general public on September 16, the company announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18/">via its website</a> following its iPhone-centric product event earlier today. We should also see updates for tvOS and the HomePod operating system on the same date.</p>
<p>The new releases bring a number of new features and refinements to Apple’s platforms: better texting with Android devices thanks to support for the RCS standard, iPhone Mirroring that allows you to interact with your iPhone via your Mac, more UI customization options for iPhones and iPads, and other improvements besides.</p>
<p>What won't be included in these initial releases is any hint of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/">Apple Intelligence</a>, the batch of generative AI and machine learning features that Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Apple is testing some of the Apple Intelligence features in betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1, updates that will be released later this fall. When Apple Intelligence does arrive, compatibility will be limited: it will require an iPhone 15 Pro or one of the just-announced iPhone 16 or 16 Pro models; an iPad Air or Pro with an M1, M2, or M4 chip; or an Apple Silicon Mac. Apple will also be withholding Apple Intelligence from devices in the EU, at least for now.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048328#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048328&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the last couple years, Apple has reserved its most significant silicon updates for its iPhone Pro models, while the less expensive non-Pro iPhones have made do with year-old chips. This year, Apple is introducing new A18-series chips for both Pro and non-Pro iPhones, chips which it says are "designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up."</p>
<p>The Apple A18 (no Pro, no Bionic, just A18) will power the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/iphone-16-gets-two-new-buttons-and-a-new-camera-look/">iPhone 16 and 16 Plus</a>—the iPhone 15 used an A16 Bionic, and jumping two chip generations in one year makes for more impressive-sounding performance numbers.</p>
<p>Like the last few generations of iPhone chip, the A18 includes a 6-core CPU with two high-performance processor cores and four high-efficiency cores. Apple says the CPU is 30 percent faster than the A16 chip in the iPhone 15. The A18 also includes a 5-core GPU that Apple says is 40 percent faster than the GPU in the iPhone 15—the A18 GPU also supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing, which was introduced in the A17 Pro.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048465#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048465&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As expected, Apple announced the new iPhone Pro models today during a livestream: the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch display, and the Max has a 6.9-inch display. That's primarily thanks to thinner borders around the displays.</p>
<p>Like the iPhone 15 Pro, the 16 Pro is made of titanium but with a new texture. Apple claims the phone has improved heat management with its new chassis, which could address some of our complaints about the iPhone 15 Pro—that means up to 20 percent faster sustained performance, too.</p>
<p>Larger batteries and efficiency improvements have led to a promise of battery life improvements, though Apple didn't say exactly how much longer they'll last during the livestream.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048412#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048412&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            The iPhone 16 has a new rear camera arrangement.                          [credit:

<p>Apple's new iPhone 16 isn't a revolution by any means, but it's a solid upgrade with a handful of new features (including two new physical buttons), plus better performance and Apple Intelligence support.</p>
<p>The design is similar to the iPhone 15 but with a vertical camera arrangement on the back, which helps take more efficient spatial photos and videos. A new camera control button can be clicked to take a photo, and also is touch-sensitive, allowing you to slide your finger across it to tweak the settings for the images, like zoom. It can tell the difference between a full click and a lighter press, which allows you to access customization features instead of taking a picture right away.</p>
<p>That's not the only new button; the configurable Action button has arrived on the iPhone 16. It was introduced in the Pro models last year and can be used for various predetermined purposes or assigned to work with Shortcuts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048405#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048405&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple announced the fourth-generation AirPods today during its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/what-to-expect-from-apples-september-9-iphone-event/">It's Glowtime event.</a> As you can tell from the gallery above, the AirPods 4 look different from their predecessor. They also have Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) if you're willing to pay extra.</p>
<p>Apple said that it mapped and analyzed "thousands" of ear shapes with 3D photogrammetry, laser topography, and other modeling tools to design the AirPods 4's new form. Apple claims the new shape will make for a better fit. The new earbuds appear to have shorter stems. They look more similar to the AirPods Pro now but without the silicone tips. The stems also allow users to play/pause media and end or mute calls with a "quick press," Apple claims, noting a new force sensor.</p>
<p>The new AirPods move from Apple's H1 chip to the H2, which the current AirPods Pro use. Compared to the H1, Apple has said that the H2 is supposed to be up to twice as good at noise cancellation. Upgraded mics and computational audio are also supposed to aid in ANC.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048354#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048354&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            If you paid $40 for the physical edition of <em>Concord</em>, you can make a lot more than that back on eBay.                          [credit:
                              Kyle Orland                            ]
                      </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>As recently as a week ago, a new disc copy of Sony's team-based shooter <em>Concord</em> on the PlayStation 5 would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240805123255/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/concord-playstation-5/6586164.p?skuId=6586164">set you back about $40 at most retailers</a>. Now that Sony has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/two-weeks-after-launch-sony-shooter-concord-goes-offline-and-offers-refunds/">shut off the game's servers after just two weeks</a>, you might think those now-useless discs would be practically worthless.</p>
<p>Instead, the physical version of <em>Concord</em> on PS5 has become a surprise collector's item. An Ars analysis of nearly 300 eBay listings completed between September 3–8 shows new copies of the now-defunct game selling for a median price of $100 since the game's shutdown. That going rate peaked at a median of $118 on September 5, up from $89.50 on September 3, before settling at $110 for eBay sales made on September 8.</p>
<h2>Supply and demand</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/meet-the-man-who-got-100000-for-a-copy-of-super-mario-bros/">usual</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/hard-to-find-nes-classic-edition-sees-200-ebay-price-markup-at-launch/">gaming collectibles</a>, the price increase has less to do with playability and more to do with rarity. GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">told IGN last month</a> that he estimated an underwhelming 25,000 total sales for <em>Concord</em> across PS5 and PC. Even if we assume 80 percent of those sales were on the PS5, most of those console sales probably came as purely digital downloads, given <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games">long-running industry trends</a> and the game's focus on online play.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048411#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048411&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The newest <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a> is all about a big screen, a thinner case, and lighter metal options, allowing for better typing and easier viewing.</p>
<p>Apple's first wide-angle OLED display inside the Series 10 is 40 percent brighter than the Series 9. It allows for a wider variety of viewing angles. Its refresh rate, when idle, can update information from apps and complications once a second instead of the existing once-a-minute rate.</p>
<p>The 9.7 mm case, the thinnest Watch so far, required miniaturization of various components, including the speaker, logic board, and metal backing. The aluminum version weighs 10 percent less than the previous generation. The titanium version, replacing stainless steel, shaves even more weight off the Watch than the already reduced Series 10.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048302#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048302&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>About 10 years ago, several folios of the mysterious Voynich manuscript were scanned using multispectral imaging. Lisa Fagin Davis, executive director of the Medieval Academy of America, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lisafdavis.bsky.social/post/3l3nur2uh6b2t">has analyzed</a> those scans and <a href="https://manuscriptroadtrip.wordpress.com/2024/09/08/multispectral-imaging-and-the-voynich-manuscript/">just posted the results</a>, along with a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BFwNZTgLqvgnIU8rmXQCdW6kIuC4baS7">downloadable set of images</a>, to her blog, Manuscript Road Trip. Among the chief findings: Three columns of lettering have been added to the opening folio that could be an early attempt to decode the script. And while questions have long swirled about whether the manuscript is authentic or a clever forgery, Fagin Davis concluded that it's unlikely to be a forgery and is a genuine medieval document.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/no-someone-hasnt-cracked-the-code-of-the-mysterious-voynich-manuscript/">previously reported</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript">Voynich manuscript</a> is a 15th century medieval handwritten text dated between 1404 and 1438, purchased in 1912 by a Polish book dealer and antiquarian named Wilfrid Voynich (hence its moniker). Along with the strange handwriting in an unknown language or code, the book is heavily illustrated with bizarre pictures of alien plants, naked women, strange objects, and zodiac symbols. It's currently kept at Yale University's Beinecke Library of rare books and manuscripts. Possible authors include Roger Bacon, Elizabethan astrologer/alchemist John Dee, or even Voynich himself, possibly as a hoax.</p>
<p>There are so many competing theories about what the Voynich manuscript is—most likely a compendium of herbal remedies and astrological readings, based on the bits reliably decoded thus far—and so many claims to have deciphered the text, that it's practically its own subfield of medieval studies. Both professional and amateur cryptographers (including codebreakers in both World Wars) have pored over the text, hoping to crack the puzzle. </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048317#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048317&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>America has been getting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/new-data-shows-which-states-were-more-deadly-for-pedestrians-in-2023/">more and more dangerous</a> for pedestrians over the past few years. It's a trend with several contributing factors—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/how-cities-can-stem-the-tide-of-pedestrian-deaths-from-large-cars-and-suvs/">our built environment</a> prioritizes passenger vehicle traffic and encourages speeding, and traffic enforcement is virtually absent in many cities. But it's undeniable that vehicle design—particularly of large pickup trucks and SUVs—has been causing excess casualties. For example, a study published in January <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/higher-vehicle-hoods-significantly-increase-pedestrian-deaths-study-finds/">found that an increase in hood height</a> of four inches (100 mm) translated to a 28 percent increase in pedestrian deaths.</p>
<p>Today, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that vehicle design needs to change to reduce the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in crashes. The notice of proposed rulemaking, which is open for public comment for the next 60 days, wants to harmonize federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) with a global standard already in effect in many countries around the world.</p>
<p>"We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians. Between 2013 and 2022, pedestrian fatalities increased 57 percent, from 4,779 to 7,522. This proposed rule will ensure that vehicles will be designed to protect those inside and outside from serious injury or death. We will continue to work to make our roads safer for everyone and help protect vulnerable road users,' said Sophie Shulman, NHTSA’s deputy administrator.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048357#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048357&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Boeing is hoping to avoid a strike Friday with a tentative deal reached Sunday with the Machinists union representing 33,000 of its West Coast employees fighting for better wages and working conditions.</p>
<p>If Boeing employees agree to the deal in a vote Thursday, their new contract will provide the "largest-ever general wage increase" in the company's history, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stephanie Pope said in a <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/Boeing-Historic-Contract-Offer-and-Tentative-Agreement-with-IAM-Districts-751-W24">press release</a>.</p>
<p>The potential deal guarantees that over the next four years, Boeing employees would receive a 25 percent pay raise, as well as "lower medical cost share to make healthcare more affordable, greater company contributions toward" retirement, and "improvements for a better work-life balance," Pope said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048333#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048333&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our main critique of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/amazons-kindle-scribe-is-pen-centric-hardware-let-down-by-book-centric-software/">Amazon's Kindle Scribe</a> when it launched in late 2022—and one that still mostly holds up—was that it felt like a big e-reader with writing functionality tacked on rather than a tablet designed specifically for writing and note-taking. Though Amazon's hardware is arguably superior (and definitely more affordable), we definitely wanted software that was closer to what was available on the reMarkable 2 tablet.</p>
<p>The reMarkable 2 mostly doesn't bother with e-reader features, though it does support EPUB and PDF documents; it's focused almost entirely on the creation and organizing of notes in various formats. And now reMarkable (the company) is out with a new reMarkable (the tablet), one that attempts to catch up with and surpass Amazon's hardware while still keeping the focus on writing.</p>
<h2>Writing is fun</h2>
<p>The new $579 reMarkable Paper Plus is an evolution of the previous design—slightly larger and heavier, but with a much bigger 11.8-inch display (up from 10.3 inches in the reMarkable 2) that also adds a front-light and color e-ink support. Where most color e-readers use E Ink's <a href="https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido3">Kaleido technology</a>, which offers faster page refresh times but relatively dull, washed-out color, the reMarkable Paper Pro uses E Ink Gallery, which has richer color reproduction at the expense of refresh speed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046927#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046927&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In recent years, the Arctic has become a magnet for <a href="https://sustainability.yale.edu/explainers/yale-experts-explain-climate-anxiety">climate change anxiety</a>, with scientists nervously <a href="https://nsidc.org/ice-sheets-today">monitoring the Greenland ice sheet</a> for signs of melting and <a href="https://undark.org/2023/09/26/arctic-lakes-carbon/">fretting</a> over rampant <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/wwii-era-arctic-military-base-polluting-greenland-1.3756786">environmental degradation</a>. It wasn’t always that way.</p>
<p>At the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, as the fear of nuclear Armageddon hung over American and Soviet citizens, ­idealistic scientists and engineers saw the vast Arctic region as a place of unlimited potential for creating a bold new future. Greenland emerged as the most tantalizing proving ground for their research.</p>
<p>Scientists and engineers working for and with the US military cooked up a rash of audacious cold-region projects—some innovative, many spit-balled, and most quickly abandoned. They were the stuff of science fiction: disposing of nuclear waste by letting it melt through the ice; moving people, supplies, and missiles below the ice using subways, some perhaps atomic powered; testing hovercraft to zip over impassable crevasses; making furniture from a frozen mix of ice and soil; and even building a nuclear-powered city under the ice sheet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048154#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048154&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As our climate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/the-climate-is-changing-so-fast-that-we-havent-seen-how-bad-extreme-weather-could-get/">warms beyond its historical range</a>, scientists increasingly need to study climates deeper in the planet’s past to get <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aay3701">information about our future</a>. One object of study is a warming event known as the Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO) from about 17 to 15 million years ago. It coincided with floods of basalt lava that covered a large area of the Northwestern US, creating what are called the “Columbia River Basalts.” This timing suggests that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL096519">volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> was the cause</a> of the warming.</p>
<p>Those eruptions were the most recent example of a “Large Igneous Province,” a phenomenon that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/when-will-the-earth-try-to-kill-us-again/">repeatedly triggered climate upheavals</a> and mass extinctions throughout Earth’s past. The Miocene version was relatively benign; it saw <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aba6853">CO<sub>2</sub> levels</a> and global temperatures rise, causing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018218308332">ecosystem changes</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X24002577">significant melting of Antarctic ice,</a> but didn’t trigger a mass extinction.</p>
<p>A paper <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52255.1/645502/High-precision-U-Pb-geochronology-for-the-Miocene">just published in Geology</a>, led by <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/dr-jennifer-kasbohm">Jennifer Kasbohm</a> of the Carnegie Science’s Earth and Planets Laboratory, upends the idea that the eruptions triggered the warming while still blaming them for the <em>peak</em> climate warmth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047424#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047424&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
