                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, Meta asked a US district court to toss a lawsuit alleging that the tech giant <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/meta-pirated-and-seeded-porn-for-years-to-train-ai-lawsuit-says/">illegally torrented pornography to train AI</a>.</p>
<p>The move comes after Strike 3 Holdings discovered illegal downloads of some of its adult films on Meta corporate IP addresses, as well as other downloads that Meta allegedly concealed using a “stealth network” of 2,500 “hidden IP addresses.” Accusing Meta of stealing porn to secretly train an unannounced adult version of its AI model powering Movie Gen, Strike 3 sought damages that could have exceeded $350 million, TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/meta-pirated-adult-film-downloads-were-for-personal-use-not-ai-training/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Filing a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Strike-3-Holdings-v-Meta-Motion-to-DIsmiss-10-27-25.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> the lawsuit on Monday, Meta accused Strike 3 of relying on “guesswork and innuendo,” while writing that Strike 3 “has been labeled by some as a ‘copyright troll’ that files extortive lawsuits.” Requesting that all copyright claims be dropped, Meta argued that there was no evidence that the tech giant directed any of the downloads of about 2,400 adult movies owned by Strike 3—or was even aware of the illegal activity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/meta-says-porn-downloads-on-its-ips-were-for-personal-use-not-ai-training/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A cargo ship from Japan pulled alongside the International Space Station on Wednesday, maneuvering close enough for the lab’s robotic arm to reach out and grab it as the vehicles soared 260 miles over the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“HTV capture complete,” Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui radioed from the ISS. “I just want to say congratulations to all teams and people involved in this mission. Also, thank you very much for your hard work and support for the first HTV-X mission.”</span></p>
<p>The HTV-X spacecraft is an upgraded cargo freighter replacing Japan’s H-II Transfer Vehicle, which successfully resupplied the space station nine times between 2009 and 2020. At the conclusion of the HTV program, Japan’s space agency preferred to focus its resources on designing a new cargo ship with more capability at a lower cost. That’s what HTV-X is supposed to be, and Wednesday’s high-flying rendezvous marked the new ship’s first delivery to the ISS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/space-station-astronauts-eager-to-open-golden-treasure-box-from-japan/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Attackers are exploiting a major weakness that has allowed them access to the NPM code repository with more than 100 credential-stealing packages since August, mostly without detection.</p>
<p>The finding, <a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/phantomraven-npm-malware-hidden-in-invisible-dependencies">laid out</a> Wednesday by security firm Koi, brings attention to an NPM practice that allows installed packages to automatically pull down and run unvetted packages from untrusted domains. Koi said a campaign it tracks as PhantomRaven has exploited NPM’s use of “Remote Dynamic Dependences” to flood NPM with 126 malicious packages that have been downloaded more than 86,000 times. Some 80 of those packages remained available as of Wednesday morning, Koi said.</p>
<h2>A blind spot</h2>
<p>“PhantomRaven demonstrates how sophisticated attackers are getting [better] at exploiting blind spots in traditional security tooling,” Koi’s Oren Yomtov wrote. “Remote Dynamic Dependencies aren’t visible to static analysis.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/npm-flooded-with-malicious-packages-downloaded-more-than-86000-times/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Steven Hatfill, a senior advisor for the Department of Health and Human Services was fired over the weekend, with health officials telling reporters that he was terminated for giving himself a fake, inflated title and for not cooperating with leadership.</p>
<p>For his part, Hatfill told The New York Times that his ouster was part of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/us/politics/hatfill-covid-hhs-ousted.html?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--l2gzrR6vqpTOeGQOtO9nd7BnancvGXWg91ooUFa9-yx1ZirevXPeurLpuEiYCAxPY_wuLsRrYSrt3sXqMhg_XXw-LTA&amp;_hsmi=387381383&amp;utm_content=387381383&amp;utm_source=hs_email">a coup to overthrow M. Kennedy</a>,” referring to anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Further, Hatfill said the coup was being orchestrated by Matt Buckham, Kennedy’s chief of staff, though Hatfill didn’t provide any explanation of how his ouster was evidence of that. An HHS spokesperson responded to the allegation, telling the Times that “firing a staff member for cause does not add up to a coup.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg was first to report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/us-fires-top-health-official-who-opposed-widely-used-covid-shots">Hatfill’s termination</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/trump-health-official-ousted-after-allegedly-giving-himself-a-fake-title/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The 2–1 vote with Republicans voting to raise the limits came with a dissent from Democrat Anna Gomez, who said the new rates will be “almost double in some facilities.” A new inflation factor will allow rates to rise further.</p>
<p>“The FCC once again is going above and beyond to address the unsubstantiated needs of monopoly providers to squeeze every penny possible from families that want to stay in touch with their loved ones,” Gomez said at the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/October2025">FCC meeting</a>. “Throughout this order, the FCC chooses to reward corporations with money taken from vulnerable families.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/fcc-republicans-force-prisoners-and-families-to-pay-more-for-phone-calls/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Social media videos have confirmed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers patrolling US streets are actively using facial recognition technology to verify citizenship, 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-and-cbp-agents-are-scanning-peoples-faces-on-the-street-to-verify-citizenship/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In one <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPxpoalD5gh">video</a> posted on a Chicago-based Instagram account, a self-described teenager and US citizen tells officers that he has no government ID. After he offers to show his student ID instead, the officer turns to another and asks, “can you do facial?” As the other officer pulls up an app to scan the teen’s face, the first officer tells the teenager to “relax” while alleging that “a lot of parents” tell their kids they were born in the US. The video ends after the officer takes the minor’s photo and asks the teen to verify that his name matches what the app’s database pulled up.</p>
<p>It’s unclear which app the officers used during this Chicago stop. But 404 Media has been closely tracking ICE and CBP’s increasing use of face scans amid the Trump administration’s nationwide mass deportation campaign, which critics slam as largely rooted in racial profiling. Earlier this year, 404 Media reviewed leaked emails confirming that ICE was using Mobile Fortify, which allows agents to scan “an unprecedented number of government databases” and compare face matches against a database of 200 million images.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/ices-forced-face-scans-to-verify-citizens-is-unconstitutional-lawmakers-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>YouTube has been streaming for 20 years, but it was only in the last couple that it came to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/for-the-first-time-ever-more-people-watched-streaming-tv-than-cable/">dominate TV streaming</a>. Google’s video platform attracts more TV viewers than Netflix, Disney+, and all the other apps, and Google is looking to further beef up its big-screen appeal with a new raft of features, including shopping, immersive channel surfing, and an official version of the AI upscaling that had creators miffed a few months back.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-features-to-help-creators/">According to Google</a>, YouTube’s growth has translated into higher payouts. The number of channels earning more than $100,000 annually is up 45 percent in 2025 versus 2024. YouTube is now giving creators some tools to boost their appeal (and hopefully their income) on TV screens. Those elaborate video thumbnails featuring surprised, angry, smiley hosts are about to get even prettier with the new 50MB file size limit. That’s up from a measly 2MB.</p>
<p>Video upscaling is also coming to YouTube, and creators will be opted in automatically. To start, YouTube will be upscaling lower-quality videos to 1080p. In the near future, Google plans to support “super resolution” up to 4K.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/tv-focused-youtube-update-brings-ai-upscaling-shopping-qr-codes/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2007’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bucket_List">The Bucket List</a>,</em> Jack Nicholson’s billionaire magnate is a fan of a luxury coffee called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_luwak">kopi luwak</a>, only to be informed that the beans first pass through the digestive tracts of civets and are harvested from their feces prior to roasting. The implication is that the billionaire just liked drinking gimmicky expensive coffee without realizing its less-than-luxurious origins. It’s one of the most expensive coffees in the world, ranging from $45 per pound to $590 per pound, depending on whether the beans are farmed or collected in the wild.</p>
<p>Whether kopi luwak is worth that hefty price tag depends on who you ask. A Washington Post food critic <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-we-can-eat/post/this-sumatran-civet-coffee-is-crareally-terrible/2012/01/02/gIQArzolaP_blog.html">once compared</a> the beverage to stale Folgers, memorably describing the flavor as “petrified dinosaur droppings steeped in bathtub water.” Yet kopi luwak has many genuine fans who claim the coffee has a unique aroma and taste. Based on a new chemical analysis, they might have a point, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-21545-x">a paper</a> published in Scientific Reports.</p>
<p>Technically, kopi luwak is a method of processing, not a specific coffee bean variety. Asian palm civets hang around coffee plantations because they love to feast on ripened coffee berries; the berries constitute most of their diet, along with various seeds. The consumed berries undergo fermentation as they pass through the animal’s intestines, and the civets digest the pulp and excrete the beans. Coffee farmers then collect the scat to recover the excreted beans and process and roast them to produce kopi luwak.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/fermentation-is-key-to-coffee-beans-gleaned-from-civet-feces/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company in history to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-poised-record-5-trillion-market-valuation-2025-10-29/">reach</a> a $5 trillion market capitalization, fresh on the heels of a GTC <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/keynote/">conference keynote</a> in Washington, DC, where CEO Jensen Huang announced $500 billion in AI chip orders and plans to build seven supercomputers for the US government. The milestone comes a mere three months after Nvidia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/ai-mania-pushes-nvidia-to-record-4-trillion-valuation/">crossed the $4 trillion mark</a> in July, vaulting the company past tech giants like Apple and Microsoft in market valuation but also driving continued fears of an AI investment bubble.</p>
<p>Nvidia’s shares have climbed nearly 12-fold since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, as the AI boom propelled the S&amp;P 500 to record highs. Shares of Nvidia stock rose 4.6 percent on Wednesday following the Tuesday announcement at the company’s GTC conference. During a Bloomberg Television interview at the event, Huang <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/nvidia-s-huang-works-to-convince-investors-there-s-no-ai-bubble">dismissed concerns</a> about overheated valuations, saying, “I don’t believe we’re in an AI bubble. All of these different AI models we’re using—we’re using plenty of services and paying happily to do it.”</p>
<p>Nvidia expects to ship 20 million units of its latest chips, compared to just 4 million units of the previous Hopper generation over its entire lifetime, Huang said at the conference. The $500 billion figure represents cumulative orders for the company’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Blackwell</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-rubin-ultra-and-feynman-ai-chips-for-2027-and-2028/">Rubin</a> processors through the end of 2026, though Huang noted that his projections did not include potential sales to China.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/nvidia-hits-record-5-trillion-mark-as-ceo-dismisses-ai-bubble-concerns/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since the dawn of civilization, leeches have been <a href="https://www.bjoms.com/article/S0266-4356(03)00242-0/ppt">firmly attached to medicine</a>. Therapeutic bloodsuckers are seen in murals decorating the tombs of 18<sup>th</sup> dynasty Egyptian pharaohs. They got their earliest written recommendation in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BC by Greek poet and physician Nicander of Colophon. He introduced the “<a href="https://topostext.org/work/852">blood-loving leech</a>, long flaccid and yearning for gore,” as a useful tool for sucking out poison after a bite from a poisonous animal. “Let leeches feed on [the] wounds and <a href="https://topostext.org/work/853">drink their fill</a>,” he wrote. Ancient Chinese writing touted their medicinal potential, too, as did references in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Galen, the physician for Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332222002670#sec0040">supported using leeches</a> to balance the four humors (i.e. blood, phlegm, and yellow and black bile) and therefore treat ailments—as initially outlined by Hippocrates. Leeches, doctors found, provided a method for less painful, localized, and limited bloodletting. We now understand that leeches can release an anesthetic to prevent pain and a powerful anticoagulant, hirudin, to prevent clotting and keep blood flowing.</p>
<p>In the centuries since the Roman era, leeches’ popularity only grew. They were used to treat everything from gout to liver disease, epilepsy, and melancholy. The very word “leech” is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word “laece,” which translates to “physician.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/man-accidentally-gets-leech-up-his-nose-it-took-20-days-to-figure-it-out/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Trusted execution environments, or TEEs, are everywhere—in blockchain architectures, virtually every cloud service, and computing involving AI, finance, and <a href="https://coalfire.com/the-coalfire-blog/why-a-cmmc-enclave-might-be-the-smartest-move-for-your-business">defense contractors</a>. It’s hard to overstate the reliance that entire industries have on three TEEs in particular: Confidential Compute from Nvidia, SEV-SNP from AMD, and SGX and TDX from Intel. All three come with assurances that confidential data and sensitive computing can’t be viewed or altered, even if a server has suffered a complete compromise of the operating kernel.</p>
<p>A trio of novel physical attacks raises new questions about the true security offered by these TEES and the exaggerated promises and misconceptions coming from the big and small players using them.</p>
<p>The most recent attack, released Tuesday, is known as TEE.fail. It defeats the latest TEE protections from all three chipmakers. The low-cost, low-complexity attack works by placing a small piece of hardware between a single physical memory chip and the motherboard slot it plugs into. It also requires the attacker to compromise the operating system kernel. Once this three-minute attack is completed, Confidential Compute, SEV-SNP, and TDX/SDX can no longer be trusted. Unlike the Battering RAM and Wiretap attacks from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/intel-and-amd-trusted-enclaves-the-backbone-of-network-security-fall-to-physical-attacks/">last month</a>—which worked only against CPUs using DDR4 memory—TEE.fail works against DDR5, allowing them to work against the latest TEEs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/new-physical-attacks-are-quickly-diluting-secure-enclave-defenses-from-nvidia-amd-and-intel/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump and the Republican Party have spent the better part of the president’s second term <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/">radically reshaping</a> the federal government. But in recent weeks, the GOP has set its sights on taking another run at an old target: the US census.</p>
<p>Since the first Trump administration, the right has sought to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/25/nx-s1-5338905/census-citizenship-question-trump">add a question</a> to the census that captures a respondent’s immigration status and to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/15/nx-s1-5467533/counted-in-the-census-congressional-redistricting-electoral-college">exclude noncitizens</a> from the tallies that determine how seats in Congress are distributed. In 2019, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-966_bq7c.pdf">struck down</a> an attempt by the first Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the census.</p>
<p>But now, a little-known algorithmic process called “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-differential-privacy-shortcomings/">differential privacy</a>,” created to keep census data from being used to identify individual respondents, has become the right’s latest focus. WIRED spoke to six experts about the GOP’s ongoing effort to falsely allege that a system created to protect people’s privacy has made the data from the 2020 census inaccurate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/republican-plan-would-make-deanonymization-of-census-data-trivial/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It has been nearly one month since many parts of the federal government shut down after lawmakers missed a budget deadline at the end of September, but so far, NASA’s most critical operations have been unaffected by the political impasse in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>That may change soon. Federal civil servants and NASA contractors are not getting paid during the shutdown, even if agency leaders have deemed their tasks essential and directed them to continue working. Jobs classified as essential include employees operating and safeguarding the International Space Station and NASA’s fleet of robotic probes exploring the Solar System and beyond.</p>
<p>Many employees at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida remain at work, too. Their job is to keep the Artemis II mission on schedule for launch as soon as next February. In the four weeks since the start of the government shutdown, crews at Kennedy Space Center have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/nasas-next-moonship-reaches-last-stop-before-launch-pad/">completed several major milestones</a> on the road to Artemis II, including the stacking of the Orion spacecraft atop its Space Launch System rocket inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building. This milestone, completed about one week ago, capped off assembly of the SLS rocket for Artemis II.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/nasa-races-to-keep-artemis-ii-on-schedule-even-when-workers-arent-being-paid/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Japan Mobility Show kicks off in Tokyo this week, and Mazda is using the occasion to show off a couple of concepts it says embody a theme called “the joy of driving fuels a sustainable tomorrow.” One of these is the Vision X-Coupe, which Mazda says shows off the evolution of its KODO design language—something we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/10/lexus-mazda-and-yamaha-wow-tokyo-with-stunning-concept-cars/">first saw at the Tokyo show a decade ago</a>.</p>
<p>You can see a clear visual link between the renderings of the Vision X-Coupe and some of Mazda’s current models like the 3 hatchback or the CX-30 crossover, but translated through the long, low form factor of a four-door coupe. The design language is perhaps less interesting than some of the sustainability ideas that Mazda is exploring here, though.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://westinghousenuclear.com/">Westinghouse</a> announced that it had reached an agreement with the Trump administration that would purportedly see $80 billion of new nuclear reactors built in the US. And the government indicated that it had finalized plans for a collaboration of GE Vernova and Hitachi to build additional reactors. Unfortunately, there are roughly zero details about the deal at the moment.</p>
<p>The agreements were apparently negotiated during President Trump’s trip to Japan. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/28195/">An announcement</a> of those agreements indicates that “Japan and various Japanese companies” would invest “up to” $332 billion for energy infrastructure. This specifically mentioned Westinghouse, GE Vernova, and Hitachi. This promises the construction of both large AP1000 reactors and small modular nuclear reactors. The announcement then goes on to indicate that many other companies would also get a slice of that “up to $332 billion,” many for basic grid infrastructure.</p>
<p>So the total amount devoted to nuclear reactors is not specified in the announcement or anywhere else. As of the publication time, the Department of Energy has no information on the deal; Hitachi, GE Vernova, and the Hitachi/GE Vernova collaboration websites are also silent on it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/westinghouse-is-claiming-a-nuclear-deal-would-see-80b-of-new-reactors/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While the underlying cause or causes of autism spectrum disorder remain elusive and appear likely to be a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, President Trump and his anti-vaccine health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—neither of whom have any scientific or medical background whatsoever—have decided to pin the blame on Tylenol, a common pain reliever and fever reducer that has no proven link to autism.</p>
<p>And now, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-paxton-sues-big-pharma-manufacturers-deceptively-marketing-tylenol-pregnant-mothers">is suing the maker of Tylenol</a>, Kenvue and Johnson &amp; Johnson, who previously sold Tylenol, claiming that they have been “deceptively marketing Tylenol” knowing that it “leads to a significantly increased risk of autism and other disorders.”</p>
<p>To back that claim, Paxton relies on the “considerable body of evidence… recently highlighted by the Trump Administration.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/if-things-in-america-werent-stupid-enough-texas-is-suing-tylenol-maker/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to be a CEO in 2025 and not catch a case of AI fever? The latest company to catch this particular cold is Lucid, the Saudi-backed electric vehicle startup. Today, it announced a new collaboration with Nvidia to use the latter’s hardware and software, with the aim of creating an autonomous vehicle for consumers. Oh, and the AI will apparently design Lucid’s production lines.</p>
<p>Formed by refugees from Tesla who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/please-dont-describe-us-as-a-tesla-killer-ars-talks-to-lucid-motors/">saw a chance to improve</a> on their past work, Lucid has already built <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-2025-lucid-air-is-now-the-most-efficient-ev-on-sale/">the most efficient EV</a> on sale in North America. But until recently, it also just had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-lucid-air-pure-review-lower-weight-better-steering-amazing-efficiency/">variants</a> of the same <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/the-lucid-air-grand-touring-is-a-startups-take-on-a-great-luxury-ev/">Air sedan</a> to offer consumers, before the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2024/12/the-2025-lucid-gravity-impresses-us-with-slick-handling-magic-ride/">Gravity SUV</a> joined the range this year.</p>
<p>The company will need to start selling tens of thousands of EVs a year before too long, especially if it’s ever to become profitable. And that will involve some smaller, cheaper models, starting with a midsize crossover sometime in 2027. A major goal for the first of those EVs is <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/lucid-believes-2027-lucid-earth-will-be-smarter-cheaper-than-rivals">a starting price of less than $50,000</a>, so I hope they’re getting a good deal on the Nvidia GPUs that Lucid now says will enable a “true eyes-off, hands-off, and mind-off” autonomous driving system for consumer-owned vehicles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/an-autonomous-car-for-consumers-lucid-says-its-happening/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>At a press conference, Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the GUARD Act, joined by grieving parents holding up photos of their children lost after engaging with chatbots.</p>
<p>If passed, the law would require chatbot makers to check IDs or use “any other commercially reasonable method” to accurately assess if a user is a minor who must be blocked. Companion bots would also have to repeatedly remind users of all ages that they aren’t real humans or trusted professionals.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/senators-move-to-keep-big-techs-creepy-companion-bots-away-from-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An AI language model like the kind that powers ChatGPT is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-personhood-trap-how-ai-fakes-human-personality/">gigantic statistical web</a> of data relationships. You give it a prompt (such as a question), and it provides a response that is statistically related and hopefully helpful. At first, ChatGPT was a tech amusement, but now hundreds of millions of people are relying on this statistical process to guide them through life’s challenges. It’s the first time in history that large numbers of people have begun to confide their feelings to a talking machine, and mitigating the potential harm the systems can cause has been an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/strengthening-chatgpt-responses-in-sensitive-conversations/">released data</a> estimating that 0.15 percent of ChatGPT’s active users in a given week have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent. It’s a tiny fraction of the overall user base, but with more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to over a million people each week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/openai-says-over-a-million-people-talk-to-chatgpt-about-suicide-weekly/">reports TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI also estimates that a similar percentage of users show heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT, and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the chatbot.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-data-suggests-1-million-users-discuss-suicide-with-chatgpt-weekly/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After kicking off an unpopular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/samsung-forces-ads-onto-fridges-is-a-bad-sign-for-other-appliances/">pilot test last month,</a> Samsung made the practice of having its expensive smart fridges display ads official this week.</p>
<p>The ads will be shown on Samsung’s 2024 Family Hub smart fridges. As of this writing, Samsung’s Family Hub fridges have MSRPs ranging from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/all-refrigerators/?shop=Buy+Online&amp;key_category_features=Family+Hub%C3%A2%C2%84%C2%A2&amp;CID=afl-ecomm-rkt-cha-040122-url_Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_source=url_Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=1&amp;utm_content=2116208&amp;rktevent=Skimlinks.com_TnL5HPStwNw-XmUXqH629_Fatbxjry_5NQ&amp;ranMID=47773&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-XmUXqH629_Fatbxjry_5NQ">$1,899 to $3,499</a>. The ads will arrive through a software update that Samsung will start issuing this month and display on the fridge’s integrated 21.5- or 32-inch (depending on the model) screen. The ads will show when the fridges are idle and display what Samsung calls Cover Screens.</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of the Family Hub software update, we are piloting a new widget for select Cover Screens themes of Family Hub refrigerators. The widget will display useful day-to-day information such as news, calendar and weather forecasts, along with curated advertisements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samsung also said that its fridges will only show contextualized ads, instead of personalized ads, which rely on collecting data on users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/samsung-makes-ads-on-3499-smart-fridges-official-with-upcoming-software-update/">Read full article</a></p>
