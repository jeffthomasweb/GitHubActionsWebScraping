<p>Most scammers and cybercriminals operate in the digital shadows and don’t want you to know how they make money. But that’s not the case for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nigerian-email-scammers-more-effective-than-ever/">Yahoo Boys</a>, a loose collective of young men in West Africa who are some of the web’s most prolific—and increasingly dangerous—scammers.</p>
<p>Thousands of people are members of dozens of Yahoo Boy groups operating across Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram, a WIRED analysis has found. The scammers, who deal in types of fraud that <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/pdf/annualreport/2023_ic3report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.ic3.gov/media/pdf/annualreport/2023_ic3report.pdf" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ic3.gov/media/pdf/annualreport/2023_ic3report.pdf"}'>total hundreds of millions of dollars</a> each year, also have dozens of accounts on TikTok, YouTube, and the document-sharing service Scribd that are getting thousands of views.</p>

<p>Do rainbows exist on distant worlds? Many phenomena that happen on Earth—such as rain, hurricanes, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/new-webb-images-of-jupiter-show-dazzling-auroras-and-two-small-moons/">auroras</a>—also occur on other planets in our Solar System if the conditions are right. Now we have evidence from outside our Solar System that one particularly strange exoplanet might even be displaying something close to a rainbow.</p>
<p>Appearing in the sky as a halo of colors, a phenomenon called a "glory" occurs when light hits clouds made up of a homogeneous substance in the form of spherical droplets. It might be the explanation for a mystery regarding observations of exoplanet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/hot-gas-giant-planet-appears-to-have-iron-rain/">WASP-76B</a>. This planet, a scorching gas giant that experiences molten iron rain, has also been observed to have more light on its eastern terminator (a line used to separate the day side from the night side) than its western terminator. Why was there more light on one side of the planet?</p>
<p>After observing it with the CHEOPS space telescope, then combining that with previous observations from Hubble, Spitzer, and TESS, a team of researchers from ESA and the University of Bern in Switzerland now think that the most likely reason for the extra light is a glory.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021697#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021697&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Translating human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses has long been fraught with gaping security risks. After all, lookups are rarely end-to-end encrypted. The servers providing domain name lookups provide translations for virtually any IP address—even when they’re known to be malicious. And many end-user devices can easily be configured to stop using authorized lookup servers and instead use malicious ones.</p>
<p>Microsoft on Friday provided a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/networking-blog/announcing-zero-trust-dns-private-preview/ba-p/4110366">peek</a> at a comprehensive framework that aims to sort out the Domain Name System (DNS) mess so that it’s better locked down inside Windows networks. It’s called ZTDNS (zero trust DNS). Its two main features are (1) encrypted and cryptographically authenticated connections between end-user clients and DNS servers and (2) the ability for administrators to tightly restrict the domains these servers will resolve.</p>
<h2>Clearing the minefield</h2>
<p>One of the reasons DNS has been such a security minefield is that these two features can be mutually exclusive. Adding cryptographic authentication and encryption to DNS often obscures the visibility admins need to prevent user devices from connecting to malicious domains or detect anomalous behavior inside a network. As a result, DNS traffic is either sent in clear text or it's encrypted in a way that allows admins to decrypt it in transit through what is essentially an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">adversary-in-the-middle attack</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021987#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021987&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Near the end of the second day of closing arguments in the Google monopoly trial, US district judge Amit Mehta weighed whether sanctions were warranted over what the US Department of Justice described as Google's "routine, regular, and normal destruction" of evidence.</p>
<p>Google was accused of enacting a policy instructing employees to turn chat history off by default when discussing sensitive topics, including Google's revenue-sharing and mobile application distribution agreements. These agreements, the DOJ and state attorneys general argued, work to maintain Google's monopoly over search.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/us-says-google-routinely-destroyed-evidence-and-lied-about-use-of-auto-delete/">destroyed potentially hundreds of thousands of chat sessions</a> not just during their investigation but also during litigation. Google only stopped the practice after the DOJ discovered the policy. DOJ's attorney Kenneth Dintzer told Mehta Friday that the DOJ believed the court should "conclude that communicating with history off shows anti-competitive intent to hide information because they knew they were violating antitrust law."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021979#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021979&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's a lot of stories about the modern PC gaming industry balled up inside one recent "update" to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4196868529806518741?l=english">announced Thursday night</a> that current players of the runaway hit co-op shooter will have to connect their Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network (PSN) account starting on May 30, with a hard deadline of June 4. New players will be required to connect the two starting Monday, May 6.</p>
<p>Officially, this is happening because of the "safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games." Account linking allows Sony to ban abusive players, and also gives banned players the right to appeal. Sony writes that it would have done this at launch, but "Due to technical issues … we allowed the linking requirements for Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network account to be temporarily optional. That grace period will now expire."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021773#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021773&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Florida resident was sentenced to 78 months for running a counterfeit scam that generated $100 million in revenue from fake networking gear and put the US military's security at risk, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Onur Aksoy, aka Ron Aksoy and Dave Durden, pleaded guilty on June 5, 2023, to two counts of an indictment charging him with conspiring with others to traffic in counterfeit goods, to commit mail fraud, and to commit wire fraud. His sentence, handed down on May 1, also includes an order to pay $100 million in restitution to Cisco, a $40,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. Aksoy will also have to pay his victims a sum that a court will determine at an unspecified future date, the DOJ said.</p>
<p>According to the indictment [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/onur_aksoy_-_indictment_redacted.pdf">PDF</a>], Aksoy began plotting the scam around August 2013, and the operation ran until at least April 2022. Aksoy used at least 19 companies and about 15 Amazon storefronts, 10 eBay ones, and direct sales—known collectively as Pro Network Entities—to sell tens of thousands of computer networking devices. He imported the products from China and Hong Kong and used fake Cisco packaging, labels, and documents to sell them as new and real. Legitimate versions of the products would've sold for over $1 billion, per the indictment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021747#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021747&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US Department of Agriculture this week posted an unpublished version of its <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.01.591751v1">genetic analysis into the spillover and spread of bird flu into US dairy cattle</a>, offering the most complete look yet at the data state and federal investigators have amassed in the unexpected and worrisome outbreak—and what it might mean.</p>
<p>The preprint analysis provides several significant insights into the outbreak—from when it may have actually started, just how much transmission we're missing, stunning unknowns about the only human infection linked to the outbreak, and how much the virus continues to evolve in cows. The information is critical as flu experts fear the outbreak is heightening the ever-present risk that this wily flu virus will evolve to spread among humans and spark a pandemic.</p>
<p>But, the information hasn't been easy to come by. Since March 25—when the USDA confirmed for the first time that a herd of US dairy cows had contracted the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus—the agency has garnered international criticism for not sharing data quickly or completely. On April 21, the agency dumped over 200 genetic sequences into public databases amid pressure from outside experts. However, many of those sequences lack descriptive metadata, which normally contains basic and key bits of information, like when and where the viral sample was taken. Outside experts don't have that crucial information, making independent analyses frustratingly limited. Thus, the new USDA analysis—which presumably includes that data—offers the best yet glimpse of the complete information on the outbreak.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021860#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021860&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On May 7, Apple will host a product announcement event at 9 am ET. Labeled "Let loose," we expect it will focus on new iPads and iPad accessories.</p>
<p>We won't be liveblogging the stream, but you can expect some news coverage as it happens. Below, we'll go over our educated guesses about why Apple might be doing this.</p>
<h2>Why hold an event now?</h2>
<p>It's unusual for Apple to host an event shortly before WWDC. New products debut at that event all the time, so if it's just a faster chip and a nicer screen for the iPad Pro and iPad Air, why not wait until June?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021920#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021920&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been a bad couple of years for Microsoft's security and privacy efforts. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/microsoft-under-fire-for-response-to-leak-of-2-4tb-of-sensitive-customer-data/">Misconfigured endpoints</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/a-renegade-certificate-is-removed-from-windows-then-it-returns-confusion-ensues/">rogue security certificates</a>, and weak passwords have all caused or risked the exposure of sensitive data, and Microsoft has been criticized by security researchers, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/us-senator-blasts-microsoft-for-negligent-cybersecurity-practices/">US lawmakers</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/microsoft-cloud-security-blasted-for-its-culture-of-toxic-obfuscation/">regulatory agencies</a> for how it has responded to and disclosed these threats.</p>

<p>The most high-profile of these breaches involved a China-based hacking group named Storm-0558, which breached Microsoft's Azure service and collected data for over a month in mid-2023 before being discovered and driven out. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/microsoft-takes-pains-to-obscure-role-in-0-days-that-caused-email-breach/">months of ambiguity</a>, Microsoft disclosed that a series of security failures gave Storm-0558 access to an engineer's account, which allowed Storm-0558 to collect data from 25 of Microsoft's Azure customers, including US federal agencies.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/microsoft-network-breached-through-password-spraying-by-russian-state-hackers/">Microsoft disclosed that it had been breached again</a>, this time by Russian state-sponsored hacking group Midnight Blizzard.

<p>China is going back to the Moon for more samples.</p>
<p>On Friday the country launched its largest rocket, the Long March 5, carrying an orbiter, lander, ascent vehicle, and a return spacecraft. The combined mass of the Chang'e-6 spacecraft is about 8 metric tons, and it will attempt to return rocks and soil from the far side of the Moon—something scientists have never been able to study before in-depth.</p>
<p>The mission's goal is to bring about 2 kg (4.4 pounds) of rocks back to Earth a little more than a month from now.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021655#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021655&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, renowned AI researcher <a href="https://karpathy.ai/">Andrej Karpathy</a>, formerly of OpenAI and Tesla, tweeted a lighthearted proposal that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/">large language models</a> (LLMs) like the one that runs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> could one day be modified to operate in or be transmitted to space, potentially to communicate with extraterrestrial life. He said the idea was "just for fun," but with his influential profile in the field, the idea may inspire others in the future.</p>

<p>Karpathy's <a href="https://karpathy.ai/">bona fides</a> in AI almost speak for themselves, receiving a PhD from Stanford under computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei-Fei_Li">Dr. Fei-Fei Li</a> in 2015. He then became one of the founding members of OpenAI as a research scientist, then served as senior director of AI at Tesla between 2017 and 2022. In 2023, Karpathy rejoined OpenAI for a year, leaving this past February. He's posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy/videos">several highly regarded tutorials</a> covering AI concepts on YouTube, and whenever he talks about AI, people listen.</p>
<p>Most recently, Karpathy has been working on a project called "<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c">llm.c</a>" that implements the training process for OpenAI's 2019 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/once-too-scary-to-release-gpt-2-gets-squeezed-into-an-excel-spreadsheet/">GPT-2</a> LLM in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">pure C</a>, dramatically speeding up the process and demonstrating that working with LLMs doesn't necessarily require complex development environments. The project's streamlined approach and concise codebase sparked Karpathy's imagination.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021482#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021482&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ecobee is killing off some of its oldest thermostats. The "Ecobee Smart Thermostat" (Model # : EB-STAT-02) and the Ecobee Energy Management System (EMS) business thermostat (Model #: EB-EMS-02) are <a href="https://support.ecobee.com/s/articles/Connectivity-and-Support-for-Legacy-Products">losing web access</a> on July 31, 2024. Every Ecobee device has nearly the same name, but these are older devices. Ecobee says these will still function as local thermostats after the shutdown, but "any features requiring connectivity to the Ecobee servers, such as control from the Ecobee Web Portal, weather information, integrations etc, will no longer function."</p>
<p>The EB-STAT-02 was "the <a href="https://smartthermostatguide.com/ecobee-eb-stat-02-smart-thermostat-review/">world’s first Wi-Fi enabled thermostat</a>" when it launched in 2008, and sales ended in 2013. Unlike the current Ecobees, this is a white rectangle that connected to a giant "<a href="https://www.ontimemall.com/ecobee-ebstat02-wireless-internet-thermostat.html">equipment interface module</a>" box you needed to hide in your HVAC system somewhere. The wall-mounted controller used an old-even-in-2009 <em>resistive</em> touchscreen, was an inch thick, and had a colorful interface that looked a lot like early versions of iOS. Most of the basics were here though, with an app that mimicked the wall controller interface, over-the-Internet control, a web portal, and access to lots of data. The EB-EMS-02 launched two years later as a commercial version of the Stat 02 and needed a subscription fee to work.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from an old Internet-connected device, the Wi-Fi support of the Stat 02 is pretty bad nowadays. According to <a href="https://support.ecobee.com/s/articles/ecobee-smart-installation-and-setup-guide">Ecobee's support page</a>, it only supported 802.11b/g for Wi-Fi (that would be "Wi-Fi 3" under the current naming scheme). Encryption went up to WPA2, and even with firmware updates, you <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/04/serious-flaws-leave-wpa3-vulnerable-to-hacks-that-steal-wi-fi-passwords/">have to</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/severe-flaw-in-wpa2-protocol-leaves-wi-fi-traffic-open-to-eavesdropping/">start</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/farewell-to-firewalls-wi-fi-bugs-open-network-devices-to-remote-hacks/">questioning</a> the security of a 16-year-old Internet-connected device. Not relying on the cloud would be nice, but at some point, you just have to throw this stuff out.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021683#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021683&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google urged a federal court to reject Epic Games' request for an injunction that would reduce Google's control of the Android app distribution and in-app payment markets.</p>
<p>"Rather than a judicial injunction against alleged violations of law, Epic asks this Court to create a new global regulatory regime that would set prices, impose ongoing duties to deal, and require the Court to micromanage on an ongoing basis a highly complex and dynamic ecosystem that is used by billions of consumers and millions of app developers and that supports the business of hundreds of OEMs and carriers around the world," stated Google's objections <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.373179/gov.uscourts.cand.373179.958.0.pdf">filed yesterday</a> in US District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>

The jury <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.373179/gov.uscourts.cand.373179.866.0.pdf">sided with Epic</a> on every question it was presented.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021743#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021743&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As civilizations evolve, so do the political regimes that govern them. But the transition from one era to another is not always quiet. Some ancient Mayan rulers made a very fiery public statement about who was in charge.</p>
<p>When archaeologists dug up the burned fragments of royal bodies and artifacts at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/10/maya-reservoirs-relied-on-aquatic-plants-like-water-lilies-to-help-keep-water-clean/">Mayan</a> archaeological site of Ucanal in Guatemala, they realized they were looking at the last remnants of a fallen regime. There was no scorching on the walls of the structure they were found beneath. This could have only meant that the remains (which had already been in their tombs a hundred years) were consumed by flames in one place and buried in another. But why?</p>
<p>The team of archaeologists, led by Christina T. Halperin of the University of Montreal, think this was the doing of a new leader who wanted to annihilate all traces of the old regime. He couldn’t just burn them. He also had to bury them where they would be forgotten.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021687#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021687&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>MONACO—It may be hard to remember, but not too long ago, Jaguar made a very nice electric vehicle. The I-Pace arrived in 2018, and it was the only EV other than the bare-bones Chevy Bolt that could compete with a Tesla on range. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/forget-about-that-tesla-the-jaguar-i-pace-is-the-most-compelling-ev-yet/">It was great to drive</a>, too. An electric replacement for the XJ sedan was meant to be next until it was canceled months before production was supposed to begin.</p>
<p>"I'd seen the car, it was a beautiful car, but when I look at the designs that we have now, when I look at the technology that we'll bring in the vehicle, it's night-and-day different," said Rawdon Glover, managing director of Jaguar. "I think that previous car would have been sort of a segue into something else, where we're doing a step change."</p>
<p>And a step change is what Jaguar Land Rover CEO (and Glover's boss) Thierry Bolloré wants for Jaguar: for it to move upmarket, the way Range Rover has. Tearing up the electric XJ was a bold step—it meant the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/how-jaguar-uses-formula-e-to-make-better-road-evs/">only new electric Jaguars to debut</a> from 2021 until 2025 would be the brand's Formula E race cars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021682#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021682&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Using nuclear fusion, the process that powers the stars, to produce electricity on Earth has famously been 30 years away for more than 70 years. But now, a breakthrough experiment done at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility in San Diego may finally push nuclear fusion power plants to be roughly 29 years away.</p>
<h2>Nuclear fusion ceiling</h2>
<p>The DIII-D facility is run by General Atomics for the Department of Energy. It includes an experimental tokamak, a donut-shaped nuclear fusion device that works by trapping astonishingly hot plasma in very strong, toroidal magnetic fields. Tokamaks, compared to other fusion reactor designs like stellarators, are the furthest along in their development; ITER, the world’s first power-plant-size fusion device now under construction in France, is scheduled to run its first tests with plasma in December 2025.</p>
<p>But tokamaks have always had some issues. Back in 1988, Martin Greenwald, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology expert on plasma physics, proposed <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/94891/86ja022_full.pdf;sequence=1">an equation</a> that described an apparent limit on how dense plasma could get in tokamaks. He argued that maximum attainable density is dictated by the minor radius of a tokamak and the current induced in the plasma to maintain magnetic stability. Going beyond that limit was supposed to make the magnets incapable of holding the plasma, heated up to north of 150 million degrees Celsius away from the walls of the machine.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021670#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021670&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

(credit: FX/Hulu)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>FX/Hulu's new historical epic series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(2024_miniseries)"><em>Shōgun,</em></a> based on the bestselling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(novel)">1975 novel</a> by James Clavell, has met with both popular and critical acclaim since its February premiere, drawing over 9 million views across all platforms in the first six days alone. The storytelling, the characters, the stellar performances, the expert pacing all contribute to that success. But it's also a visually stunning achievement that brings 17th-century feudal Japan to vivid life, thanks to masterful special effects that have been woven in so seamlessly, it can be challenging to distinguish between the CGI and the real footage.</p>
<p>The novel is a fictionalized account of the key players and events in 17th-century feudal Japan that ultimately led to the naming of a new <em>shōgun </em>(central ruler), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, and the advent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period">Edo period</a>. The climactic event was the October 21, 1600, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sekigahara">Battle of Sekigahara</a>, in which Tokugawa defeated a coalition of clans led by <a title="Ishida Mitsunari" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishida_Mitsunari">Ishida Mitsunari</a>. Clavell's novel also includes a fictionalized version of an English navigator named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adams_(pilot)">William Adams</a>, aka Miura Anjiin ("the pilot of Miura"), who was the first of his nation to reach Japan in 1600, eventually becoming a samurai and one of Tokugawa's key advisers.</p>
<p>Clavell's epic saga was a blockbuster success, selling over 6 million copies by 1980. The author changed the names of all the main characters, purportedly to "add narrative deniability," and despite some inevitable inaccuracies and authorial liberties, the novel is breathtaking in scope, chock-full of encyclopedic period details. In fact, <em>Shōgun</em> is often credited with introducing an entire generation of Western readers to Japanese history and culture. "In sheer quantity, <em>Shōgun</em> has probably conveyed more information about Japan to more people than all the combined writings of scholars, journalists, and novelists since the Pacific War," an editor named Henry Smith <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H2K6AU/?tag=arstech20-20">wrote in 1980</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020393#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020393&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Join Your Local Militia or III% Patriot Group,” a post urged the more than 650 members of a Facebook group called the Free American Army. Accompanied by the logo for the Three Percenters militia network and an image of a man in tactical gear holding a long rifle, the post continues: “Now more than ever. Support the American militia page.”</p>
<p>Other content and messaging in the group is similar.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>No car company in recent years has been able to generate more news headlines than Tesla. Its original founders were among the very first to realize that lithium-ion laptop cells were just about good enough to power a car, assuming you put enough of them in a pack, and with critical funding from current CEO Elon Musk, the company was able to kick-start an electric vehicle revolution. But those headlines of late have been painting a picture of a company in chaos. Sales are down, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-profits-drop-55-as-elon-musk-dodges-cheap-car-questions/">the cars are barely profitable</a>, and now the CEO is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-to-lay-off-everyone-working-on-superchargers-new-vehicles/">culling vast swaths of the company</a>. Just what is going on?</p>
<h2>Tesla had some good times</h2>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/08/elon-musk-tweets-he-has-funding-to-take-tesla-private/">Always erratic</a>, Musk's leadership has nevertheless seen the company sell electric cars in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/tesla-sold-1-8-million-electric-vehicles-in-2023/">volume</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/tesla-reports-its-first-annual-profit/">profitably</a>. What's more, Musk has at times been able to inspire faith in and devotion to his company's products in a way that makes the late Steve Jobs look like a neophyte—after the Model 3 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/04/teslas-model-3-is-herethese-are-the-details-youve-been-waiting-for/">debuted in 2016</a>, 450,000 people gave $1,000 deposits to Tesla for a product that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/03/tesla-model-3-reservations-begin-march-31-how-to-be-near-the-top-of-the-list/">wouldn't go into production for at least 18 months</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that example also illustrates a long-running concern with the company and Musk's investment-attracting pitches: overhyping and underdelivering. By 2018, <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1117043_study-shows-23-percent-cancelations-on-tesla-model-3-deposits">more than one in five</a> reservation holders wanted a refund after cheaper models were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-in-model-3-production-hell/">delayed</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/tesla-announces-35000-model-3-is-closing-its-stores-to-pay-for-it/">delayed</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021522#p3">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021522&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You can't buy <em>Mini Settlers</em> right now, but I think you should play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2788870/Mini_Settlers_Prologue/?snr=1_5_1100__1100&amp;utm_source=steamwidget">the free "Prologue" demo</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521630/Mini_Settlers/">wishlist the full game</a> if you dig it. It's not quite like any other city builder I've played.</p>
<p><em>Mini Settlers </em>is "mini" like minimalism. It is in the same genre, but quite far from, games like <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> (a choice with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/">some proven merit</a>). Your buildings are not 3D-rendered with real-time lighting. Your buildings are colored squares, sometimes with a few disc tokens stacked on them, tabletop-style. Your roads don't have traffic, but they have drivers (tiny squares) that take resources between nodes. When things go wrong, you don't get depressing news about pollution and riots; some people just leave their homes, but they'll come back if you fix what's wrong.</p>

<p>Mini Settlers is not the game to play to satisfy your long-running suspicion that urban planning was your missed calling.
