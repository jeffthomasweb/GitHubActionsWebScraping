                            <![CDATA[<p>For millennia, some of the world’s largest filter-feeding whales, including humpbacks, fin whales, and blue whales, have undertaken some of the <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07092025/blue-corridors-whale-superhighways-conservation/">longest migrations</a> on earth to travel between their warm breeding grounds in the tropics to nutrient-rich feeding destinations in the poles each year.</p>
<p>“Nature has finely tuned these journeys, guided by memory and environmental cues that tell whales when to move and where to go,” said Trisha Atwood, an ecologist and associate professor at Utah State University’s Quinney College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. But, she said, climate change is “scrambling these signals,” forcing the marine mammals to veer off course. And they’re not alone.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Atwood joined more than 70 other scientists to discuss the global impacts of climate change on migratory species in a workshop convened by the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The organization monitors and protects more than 1,000 species that cross borders in search of food, mates, and favorable conditions to nurture their offspring.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/whale-and-dolphin-migrations-are-being-disrupted-by-climate-change/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers and users of LLMs have long been aware that AI models have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/ai-chatbots-tell-users-what-they-want-to-hear-and-thats-problematic/">a troubling tendency to tell people what they want to hear</a>, even if that means being less accurate. But many reports of this phenomenon amount to mere anecdotes that don’t provide much visibility into how common this sycophantic behavior is across frontier LLMs.</p>
<p>Two recent research papers have come at this problem a bit more rigorously, though, taking different tacks in attempting to quantify exactly how likely an LLM is to listen when a user provides factually incorrect or socially inappropriate information in a prompt.</p>
<h2>Solve this flawed theorem for me</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04721">one pre-print study</a> published this month, researchers from Sofia University and ETH Zurich looked at how LLMs respond when false statements are presented as the basis for difficult mathematical proofs and problems. The <a href="https://www.sycophanticmath.ai/">BrokenMath benchmark</a> that the researchers constructed starts with “a diverse set of challenging theorems from advanced mathematics competitions held in 2025.” Those problems are then “perturbed” into versions that are “demonstrably false but plausible” by an LLM that’s checked with expert review.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/are-you-the-asshole-of-course-not-quantifying-llms-sycophancy-problem/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The outage that hit Amazon Web Services and took out vital services worldwide was the result of a single failure that cascaded from system to system within Amazon’s sprawling network, according to a post-mortem from company engineers.</p>
<p>The series of failures lasted for 15 hours and 32 minutes, Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/">said</a>. Network intelligence company Ookla <a href="https://www.ookla.com/articles/aws-outage-q4-2025">said</a> its DownDetector service received more than 17 million reports of disrupted services offered by 3,500 organizations. The three biggest countries where reports originated were the US, the UK, and Germany. Snapchat, AWS, and Roblox were the most reported services affected. Ookla said the event was “among the largest internet outages on record for Downdetector.”</p>
<h2>It’s <em>always</em> DNS</h2>
<p>Amazon said the root cause of the outage was a software bug in software running the DynamoDB DNS management system. The system monitors the stability of load balancers by, among other things, periodically creating new DNS configurations for endpoints within the AWS network. A race condition is an error that makes a process dependent on the timing or sequence events that are variable and outside the developers’ control. The result can be unexpected behavior and potentially harmful failures.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/a-single-point-of-failure-triggered-the-amazon-outage-affecting-millions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A 61-year-old man in California is lucky to be alive after a combination of herbal supplements he was taking for joint pain ended up utterly wrecking his body, landing him in intensive care and in a delirious state for months. His case is reported in <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1203?utm_source=cmpnr&amp;utm_campaign=aimcc_20251021&amp;utm_content=1&amp;cmp=1&amp;utm_medium=email">the Annals of Internal Medicine: Clinical Cases</a>.</p>
<p>The man turned up at a hospital in San Francisco in bad shape, but with nonspecific problems that had begun just two days earlier. His back hurt, he was feverish, nauseous, bloated, and he hadn’t been eating much. He was so weak he couldn’t walk or get out of bed without help. His heart rate and breathing rate were high. His blood pressure was low. There were multiple wounds on his lower body in various stages of healing.</p>
<p>Initial exams and lab work revealed <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>bacteria in his blood. There was also an abscess on his shoulder and an infection in and around his spine, which was worsening. Doctors wanted to perform a surgical procedure to relieve the pressure building up on his spinal cord and nerves, but his blood pressure was too low—and then he went into hemorrhagic shock from bleeding in his gastrointestinal tract. Doctors transferred him to the intensive care unit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/man-takes-herbal-pain-quackery-nearly-dies-spends-months-in-hospital/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the things that emerging diseases, including the COVID and Zika pandemics, have taught us is that it’s tough to keep up with infectious diseases in the modern world. Things like air travel can allow a virus to spread faster than our ability to develop therapies. But that doesn’t mean biotech has stood still; companies have been developing technologies that could allow us to rapidly respond to future threats.</p>
<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of ideas out there. But this week saw some early clinical trial results of one technique that could be useful for a range of infectious diseases. We’ll go over the results as a way to illustrate the sort of thinking that’s going on, along with the technologies we have available to pursue the resulting ideas.</p>
<h2>The best antibodies</h2>
<p>Any emerging disease leaves a mass of antibodies in its wake—those made by people in response to infections and vaccines, those made by lab animals we use to study the infectious agent, and so on. Some of these only have a weak affinity for the disease-causing agent, but some of them turn out to be what are called “broadly neutralizing.” These stick with high affinity not only to the original pathogen, but most or all of its variants, and possibly some related viruses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/dna-and-jolts-of-electricity-get-people-to-make-optimal-antibodies/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Digital reading devices like the Kindle have existed for almost 20 years, and the standard eReader form factor has hardly changed at all. Amazon, Boox, and a few other companies have offered larger E Ink screens, but how about something smaller? Boox has unveiled its second-generation Palma e-reader, which still fits in your pocket but adds a color screen and mobile data connectivity.</p>
<p>The first-gen Palma launched last year, earning fans who saw it as a way to read and access some apps without the full spate of distracting smartphone experiences. Boox e-readers are essentially Android tablets with E Ink screens and a few software quirks that arise from their unofficial Google Play implementation. The second-gen Palma might offer more opportunities for distraction because it’s <em>almost</em> a smartphone.</p>
<p>The Palma 2 Pro upgrades the 6.1-inch monochrome display from the original to a 6.13-inch color E Ink Kaleido display. That’s the same technology used in Amazon’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/">Kindle Colorsoft</a>. The Amazon reader is a bit larger with its 7-inch display and chunkier bezels. Of course, the Kindle isn’t trying to fit in your pocket like the Palma 2 Pro, which is roughly the size and shape of a phone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/the-android-powered-boox-palma-2-pro-fits-in-your-pocket-but-its-not-a-phone/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>Who are these “friends”? Trump named “great people like [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang, [Salesforce CEO] Marc Benioff, and others” who told him that “the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/troops-in-us-cities-tech-billionaires-are-shaping-that-too/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Tesla rolled out a new firmware update that added a pair of new driving modes for the controversial full self-driving (FSD) feature. One, called “Sloth,” relaxes acceleration and stays in its lane. The other, called “Mad Max,” does the opposite: It speeds and swerves through traffic to get you to your destination faster. And after multiple reports of FSD Teslas doing just that, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to know more.</p>
<p>In fact, “Mad Max” mode is not entirely new—Tesla beta-tested the same feature in Autopilot in 2018, before deciding not to roll it out in a production release after widespread outcry.</p>
<p>These days, the company is evidently feeling less constrained; despite having just lost a federal wrongful death lawsuit that will cost it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/tesla-loses-autopilot-wrongful-death-case-in-329-million-verdict/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a>, it described the new mode as being able to drive “through traffic at an incredible pace, all while still being super smooth. It drives your car like a sports car. If you are running late, this is the mode for you.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/feds-probe-tesla-about-its-mad-max-mode/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Meta violated the Digital Services Act (DSA) by failing to give Facebook and Instagram users simple mechanisms to report illegal content, the European Commission said in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2503">preliminary decision</a> announced yesterday. Meta also failed to give users an effective way to challenge content moderation decisions, the EC said.</p>
<p>“When it comes to Meta, neither Facebook nor Instagram appear to provide a user-friendly and easily accessible ‘Notice and Action’ mechanism for users to flag illegal content, such as child sexual abuse material and terrorist content,” the EC press release said. The EC said that Meta mechanisms seem to “impose several unnecessary steps and additional demands on users. In addition, both Facebook and Instagram appear to use so-called ‘dark patterns,’ or deceptive interface designs, when it comes to the ‘Notice and Action’ mechanisms.”</p>
<p>The EC also found that the content moderation appeal mechanisms used by Facebook and Instagram do not “allow users to provide explanations or supporting evidence to substantiate their appeals. This makes it difficult for users in the EU to further explain why they disagree with Meta’s content decision, limiting the effectiveness of the appeals mechanism.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trump-tariff-threats-havent-stopped-eu-from-cracking-down-on-meta/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is rolling out a new face for its AI, and its name is Mico. The company announced the new, animated blob-like avatar for Copilot’s voice mode yesterday as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsoft-makes-copilot-human-centered-with-a-90s-style-animated-assistant/">a “human-centered” rebranding</a> of Microsoft’s Copilot AI efforts.</p>
<p>Mico is part of a Microsoft program dedicated to the idea that “technology should work in service of people,” Microsoft wrote. The company insists this effort is “not [about] chasing engagement or optimizing for screen time. We’re building AI that gets you back to your life. That deepens human connection.”</p>
<p>Mico has drawn instant and obvious comparisons to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/adorable-redesigned-emoji-including-clippy-included-in-latest-windows-11-update/">Clippy</a>, the animated paperclip that popped up to offer help with Microsoft Office <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QBlKo6o4Ec">starting in the ’90s</a>. Microsoft has leaned into this comparison with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805411/clippy-has-returned-as-a-copilot-easter-egg">an Easter egg that can transform Mico into an animated Clippy</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/microsofts-mico-heightens-the-risks-of-parasocial-llm-relationships/">Read full article</a></p>

The company continues to deny allegations of making “materially untrue” statements during its inial public offering but says it agreed to pay $250 million to clear itself of distractions as it focuses on building its next EV, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/rivian-reveals-three-new-smaller-electric-suvs-the-r2-r3-and-r3x/">mass-market R2</a>, which is due next year.</p>
<p>Rivian was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/rivian-hit-with-shareholder-lawsuit-over-surprise-ev-truck-price-hike/">first sued by a shareholder in 2022</a> over claims that the startup knew it would cost far more for it to build each R1T electric truck and R1S electric SUV than the advertised $67,500 and $70,000 prices, respectively. A big surprise price increase would tarnish the nascent automaker’s reputation, the lawsuit claimed, and could lead to many of the almost 56,000 pre-orders being canceled.</p>
<p>Just a few months after its November 2021 IPO, the company had indeed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/rivian-surprises-outrages-ev-truck-buyers-with-20-price-hike/">issued a hefty price hike</a>: $79,500 for the R1T and $84,500 for the R1S SUV. After an outcry, the company said it would honor the original price for its existing preorders. By that point, though, the damage was done, and more than a third of the company’s value was erased within a few days, the lawsuit alleged.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/rivian-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-for-250-million-denies-allegations/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There are three species of bats that eat birds. We know that because we have found feathers and other avian remains in their feces. What we didn’t know was how exactly they hunt birds, which are quite a bit heavier, faster, and stronger than the insects bats usually dine on.</p>
<p>To find out, Elena Tena, a biologist at Doñana Biological Station in Seville, Spain, and her colleagues attached ultra-light sensors to <em>Nyctalus Iasiopterus</em>, the largest bats in Europe. What they found was jaw-droppingly brutal.</p>
<h2>Inconspicuous interceptors</h2>
<p><em>Nyctalus Iasiopterus</em>, otherwise known as greater noctule bats, have a wingspan of about 45 centimeters. They have reddish-brown or chestnut fur with a slightly paler underside, and usually weigh around 40 to 60 grams. Despite that minimal weight, they are the largest of the three bat species known to eat birds, so the key challenge in getting a glimpse into the way they hunt was finding sensors light enough to not impede the bats’ flight.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/tracking-bats-as-they-hunt-birds-in-the-skies-above-europe/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte led a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia">disastrous military campaign</a> into Moscow. The death toll was devastating: Out of some 615,000 men, only about 110,000 survivors returned. (Napoleon abandoned his army in early December to return home on a sled.) Roughly 100,000 of the casualties died in battle, while as many as 300,000 perished from a combination of the bitter cold of Russia’s notoriously harsh winter, starvation, and disease.</p>
<p>Scholars have debated precisely what kinds of diseases ravaged Napoleon’s troops. New DNA analysis of some soldiers’ remains has revealed the presence of two pathogens in particular, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01247-3">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. The first is <em>Salmonella enterica</em>, which causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratyphoid_fever">paratyphoid fever</a>; the second is <em>Borrelia recurrentis</em>, which is transmitted by body lice and causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapsing_fever">relapsing fever</a>. (A preprint of the paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.12.664512v1">appeared on bioaRxiv</a> in July.)</p>
<p>“It’s very exciting to use a technology we have today to detect and diagnose something that was buried for 200 years,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102613?">said co-author Nicolás Rascovan</a> of the Institut Pasteur. “Accessing the genomic data of the pathogens that circulated in historical populations helps us to understand how infectious diseases evolved, spread, and disappeared over time and to identify the social or environmental contexts that played a part in these developments. This information provides us with valuable insights to better understand and tackle infectious diseases today.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/dna-analysis-reveals-likely-pathogens-that-killed-napoleons-army/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Universe Browser makes some big promises to its potential users. Its online advertisements claim it’s the “fastest browser,” that people using it will “avoid privacy leaks” and that the software will help “keep you away from danger.” However, everything likely isn’t as it seems.</p>
<p>The browser, which is linked to Chinese online gambling websites and is thought to have been downloaded millions of times, actually routes all Internet traffic through servers in China and “covertly installs several programs that run silently in the background,” according to <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/vault-viper-high-stakes-hidden-threats">new findings</a> from network security company Infoblox. The researchers say the “hidden” elements include features similar to malware—including “key logging, surreptitious connections,” and changing a device’s network connections.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, the Infoblox researchers who collaborated with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on the work, found links between the browser’s operation and Southeast Asia’s sprawling, <a href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2025/Inflection_Point_2025.pdf">multibillion-dollar cybercrime ecosystem</a>, which has connections to money-laundering, illegal online gambling, human trafficking, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pig-butchering-scam-invasion/">scam operations that use forced labor</a>. The browser itself, the researchers says, is directly linked to a network around major online gambling company BBIN, which the researchers have labeled a threat group they call Vault Viper.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/this-browser-claims-perfect-privacies-protection-but-it-acts-like-malware/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Demolition crews starting tearing down the East Wing of the presidential mansion Tuesday to clear room for the construction of a new $300 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a recent priority of President Donald Trump. The teardown drew criticism and surprise from <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawmakers-trumps-demolition-east-wing-126808050">Democratic lawmakers</a>, <a href="https://x.com/davidaxelrod/status/1980777031421034551">former White House staffers</a>, and members of the public.</p>
<p>It was, after all, just three months ago that President Donald Trump defended his ballroom plan by saying it wouldn’t affect the existing structure at the White House. “It won’t interfere with the current building,” he said in July. “It’ll be near it but not touching it—and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/satellite-shows-whats-really-happening-at-the-east-wing-of-the-white-house/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.16 of the Rocket Report! The 10th anniversary of SpaceX’s first Falcon 9 rocket landing is coming up at the end of this year. We’re still waiting for a second company to bring back an orbital-class booster from space for a propulsive landing. Two companies, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and China’s LandSpace, could join SpaceX’s exclusive club as soon as next month. (Bezos might claim <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/679116636310360067">he’s already part of the club</a>, but there’s a distinction to be made.) Each company is in the final stages of launch preparations<span class="s1">—Blue Origin for its second New Glenn rocket, and LandSpace for the debut flight of its Zhuque-3 rocket. Blue Origin and LandSpace will both attempt to land their first stage boosters downrange from their launch sites. They’re not exactly in a race with one another, but it will be fascinating to see how New Glenn and Zhuque-3 perform during the uphill and downhill phases of flight, and whether one or both of the new rockets stick the landing.</span></p>

<p><b>The race for space-based interceptors. </b>The Trump administration’s announcement of the Golden Dome missile defense shield has set off a race among US companies to develop and test space weapons, some of them on their own dime, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/california-startup-to-demonstrate-space-weapon-on-its-own-dime/">Ars reports</a>. One of these companies is a 3-year-old startup named Apex, which announced plans to test a space-based interceptor as soon as next year. Apex’s concept will utilize one of the company’s low-cost satellite platforms outfitted with an “Orbital Magazine” containing multiple interceptors, which will be supplied by an undisclosed third-party partner. The demonstration in low-Earth orbit could launch as soon as June 2026 and will test-fire two interceptors from Apex’s Project Shadow spacecraft. The prototype interceptors could pave the way for operational space-based interceptors to shoot down ballistic missiles.

More recently, the team has been working on Sky, a context-aware AI interface layer on top of macOS. The financial terms of the acquisition have not been publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>“AI progress isn’t only about advancing intelligence—it’s about unlocking it through interfaces that understand context, adapt to your intent, and work seamlessly,” an OpenAI rep wrote in the company’s blog post about the acquisition. The post goes on to specify that OpenAI plans to “bring Sky’s deep macOS integration and product craft into ChatGPT, and all members of the team will join OpenAI.”</p>
<p>That includes SAI co-founders Ari Weinstein (CEO), Conrad Kramer (CTO), and Kim Beverett (Product Lead)—all of whom worked together for several years at Apple after Apple acquired Weinstein and Kramer’s previous company, which produced an automation tool called Workflows, to integrate Shortcuts across Apple’s software platforms.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-acquires-the-team-that-made-apples-shortcuts/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Reddit alleged that Perplexity feeds off Reddit and Google, claiming to be “the world’s first answer engine” but really doing “nothing groundbreaking.”</p>
<p>“Its answer engine simply uses a different company’s” large language model “to parse through a massive number of Google search results to see if it can answer a user’s question based on those results,” the lawsuit said. “But Perplexity can only run its ‘answer engine’ by wrongfully accessing and scraping Reddit content appearing in Google’s own search results from Google’s own search engine.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/reddit-sues-to-block-perplexity-from-scraping-google-search-results/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On the surface, it seems obvious that training an LLM with “high quality” data will lead to better performance than feeding it any old “low quality” junk you can find. Now, a group of researchers is attempting to quantify just how much this kind of low quality data can cause an LLM to experience effects akin to human “brain rot.”</p>
<p>For <a href="https://llm-brain-rot.github.io/">a pre-print paper published this month</a>, the researchers from Texas A&amp;M, the University of Texas, and Purdue University drew inspiration from existing research showing how humans who consume “large volumes of trivial and unchallenging online content” can develop problems with attention, memory, and social cognition. That led them to what they’re calling the “LLM brain rot hypothesis,” summed up as the idea that “continual pre-training on junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in LLMs.”</p>
<p>Figuring out what counts as “junk web text” and what counts as “quality content” is far from a simple or fully objective process, of course. But the researchers used a few different metrics to tease a “junk dataset” and “control dataset” from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/enryu43/twitter100m_tweets">HuggingFace’s corpus of 100 million tweets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/researchers-show-that-training-on-junk-data-can-lead-to-llm-brain-rot/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The end of the dinosaurs was clearly linked to an asteroid impact that brought the Cretaceous period to a close. But the details of their end have remained a matter of debate since the impact crater was discovered. There is a lot of evidence that the impact alone <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/10/dust-of-death-did-it-do-in-the-dinosaurs/">should have been enough to do them in</a>. But the asteroid arrived amid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/new-dates-show-massive-volcanic-eruptions-overlapped-with-dinosaurs-death/">major volcanic eruptions</a> associated with previous mass extinctions. And fossils dating to just before the impact have suggested that dinosaur-dominated ecosystems had become less diverse, making them more prone to collapse.</p>
<p>Now, a new study has revealed that fossils we already know about originated within the last few hundred thousand years before the impact that killed off all dinosaurs except birds. The results indicate that species richness wasn’t likely to be a problem—at least in the neighborhood of the impact itself.</p>
<h2>Wyoming vs. New Mexico</h2>
<p>Most of what we know about the last days of the non-avian dinosaurs comes from the Hell Creek Formation, rich fossil beds in present-day Wyoming. These not only date from within a few hundred thousand years prior to the impact, but there may be deposits that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/scientists-say-they-have-deposits-formed-hours-after-dino-killing-impact/">capture the immediate aftermath</a> of the impact. Beyond this area, which reflects the ecosystem of the northern Great Plains, we have little else. It hasn’t been clear whether the diversity of species present at Hell Creek reflects what was present more globally, or if there were regional differences in ecosystems</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/dinosaurs-may-have-flourished-right-up-to-when-the-asteroid-hit/">Read full article</a></p>
