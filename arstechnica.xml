                            <![CDATA[<p>As you might imagine, a steady stream of cars to review comes and goes from my parking spot. Some weeks, they stand out, like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-aston-martin-vantage-great-but-frustrating/">bright green Aston Martin</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-bentley-continental-gt-the-highs-and-lows-of-borrowed-bits/">murdered-out Bentley</a>, or the VW ID. Buzz you can read about soon; these cars usually spark conversations with neighbors, particularly those who don't know why there's a different vehicle in that spot each week.</p>
<p>At other times, the vehicles are more anonymous, and I'm not sure this ADX sparked any community discussions. Compact crossovers are a popular breed and blend into the background. Particularly when they're painted an unobtrusive shade.</p>
<p>Which is not to say the ADX is not handsome; the Urban Gray Pearl paint looked good even in the near-constant rain (which explains the Acura-supplied images rather than my own) that coincided with our time with the tester. And from the driver's seat, the view down the hood, along those creases, is a lot more interesting than most comparable crossovers, considering the ADX's $35,000 starting price.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/2025-acura-adx-review-a-crossover-that-balances-budget-with-vigor/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>You can expect our coverage in those areas to continue, but it's important for Ars to ensure our editors stay on top of what our readers are most interested in. As we plan our approach for the coming months, we'd like to hear from you about what you'd like to see more of at Ars.</p>
<p>For example, do you want to see more focus on reviews of consumer technology? Is there a hunger for closer coverage of applications, toolkits, and issues relevant to professional software developers? Should we invest more effort in covering the latest AAA games on Steam?

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.47 of the Rocket Report! Let's hope not, but the quarrel between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk may be remembered as "Black Thursday" for the US space program. A simmering disagreement over Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill" coursing its way through Congress erupted into public view, with two of the most powerful Americans trading insults and threats on social media. Trump suggested the government should terminate "Elon's governmental contracts and subsidies." Musk responded with a post saying SpaceX will begin decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft used to transport crew and cargo to the International Space Station. This could go a number of ways, but it's hard to think anything good will come of it.</p>

<p><b>Blue Origin flies aces suborbital space shot. </b>Blue Origin, the space company founded and owned by Jeff Bezos, launched six people to the edge of space Saturday, May 31, from Bezos' ranch in West Texas, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blue-origin-launches-six-passengers-on-sub-orbital-trip-to-the-edge-of-space/">CBS News reports</a>. A hydrogen-fueled New Shepard booster propelled a crew capsule, equipped with the largest windows of any operational spaceship, to an altitude of nearly 65 miles (105 kilometers), just above the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space, before beginning the descent to landing. The passengers included three Americans—Aymette Medina Jorge, Gretchen Green, and Paul Jeris—along with Canadian Jesse Williams, New Zealand's Mark Rocket, and Panamanian Jaime Alemán, who served as his country's ambassador to the United States.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/rocket-report-spacexs-500th-falcon-launch-why-did-uks-reaction-engines-fail/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google wasn't around for the advent of the World Wide Web, but it successfully remade the web on its own terms. Today, any website that wants to be findable has to play by Google's rules, and after years of search dominance, the company has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">lost a major antitrust case</a> that could reshape both it and the web.</p>
<p>The closing arguments in the case <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-and-doj-tussle-over-how-ai-will-remake-the-web-in-antitrust-closing-arguments/">just wrapped up last week</a>, and Google could be facing serious consequences when the ruling comes down in August. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">Losing Chrome</a> would certainly change things for Google, but the Department of Justice is pursuing other remedies that could have even more lasting impacts. During his testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai seemed genuinely alarmed at the prospect of being forced to license Google's search index and algorithm, the so-called data remedies in the case. He claimed this would be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/sundar-pichai-says-doj-demands-are-a-de-facto-spin-off-of-google-search/">no better than a spinoff of Google Search</a>. The company's statements have sometimes derisively referred to this process as "white labeling" Google Search.</p>
<p>But does a white label Google Search sound so bad? Google has built an unrivaled index of the web, but the way it shows results has become increasingly frustrating. A handful of smaller players in search have tried to offer alternatives to Google's search tools. They all have different approaches to retrieving information for you, but they agree that spinning off Google Search could change the web again. Whether or not those changes are positive depends on who you ask.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/06/googles-nightmare-how-a-search-spin-off-could-remake-the-web/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Negotiations over the US federal budget for fiscal year 2026 are in the beginning stages, but when it comes to space, the fault lines are already solidifying in the Senate.</p>
<p>The Trump White House released its budget request last Friday, and this included <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/fy-2026-budget-request/">detailed information</a> about its plans for NASA. On Thursday, just days later, the US Senate shot back with its own budget priorities for the space agency.</p>
<p>The US budget process is complicated and somewhat broken in recent years, as Congress has failed to pass a budget on time. So, we are probably at least several months away from seeing a final fiscal year 2026 budget from Congress. But we got our first glimpse of the Senate's thinking when the chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released his "legislative directives" for NASA on Thursday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/senate-response-to-white-house-budget-for-nasa-keep-sls-nix-science/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Discord members are biting their nails. As reports swirl that the social media company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/discords-cto-is-just-as-worried-about-enshittification-as-you-are-173049834.html">is planning an initial public offering</a> this year and increasingly leans on advertising revenue, there's fear that Discord will become engulfed in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/as-internet-enshittification-marches-on-here-are-some-of-the-worst-offenders/">enshittification</a> that has already scarred so many online communities. Co-founder and CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy claims he's worried about that, too.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/discords-cto-is-just-as-worried-about-enshittification-as-you-are-173049834.html">Engadget </a>published today, Vishnevskiy claimed that Discord employees regularly discuss concerns about Discord going astray and angering users.</p>
<p>"I understand the anxiety and concern," Vishnevskiy said. "I think the things that people are afraid of are what separate a great, long-term focused company from just any other company."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/discord-cto-says-hes-constantly-bringing-up-enshittification-during-meetings/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A remarkable schoolyard brawl erupted online Thursday between President Donald Trump and his former "First Buddy" Elon Musk during which the pair traded insults and barbs. The war of words reached a crescendo during the afternoon when Trump threatened Musk's federal contracts.</p>
<p>"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114632206992330264">Trump wrote</a> on his social media network, Truth Social, at 2:37 pm ET.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It seems like hardly a day goes by anymore without a new version of Google's Gemini AI landing, and sure enough, Google is rolling out a major update to its most powerful 2.5 Pro model. This release is aimed at fixing some problems that cropped up in an earlier Gemini Pro update, and the word is, this version will become a stable release that comes to the Gemini app for everyone to use.</p>
<p>The previous Gemini 2.5 Pro release, known as the I/O Edition, or simply 05-06, was focused on coding upgrades. <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-pro-latest-preview/">Google claims</a> the new version is even better at generating code, with a new high score of 82.2 percent in the Aider Polyglot test. That beats the best from OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek by a comfortable margin.</p>
<p>While the general-purpose Gemini 2.5 Flash has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/gemini-2-5-is-leaving-preview-just-in-time-for-googles-new-250-ai-subscription/">left preview</a>, the Pro version is lagging behind. In fact, the last several updates have attracted some valid criticism of 2.5 Pro's performance outside of coding tasks since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">big 03-25 update</a>. Google's Logan Kilpatrick <a href="https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1930657743251349854">says</a> the team has taken that feedback to heart and that the new model "closes [the] gap on 03-25 regressions." For example, users will supposedly see more creativity with better formatting of responses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-releases-updated-gemini-2-5-pro-says-its-the-most-intelligent-model-yet/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, the GPU itself is less interesting than the storm Nvidia stirred up by trying to earn it better reviews. If you don’t follow the twists and turns of graphics card launch metanarratives, allow me to recap the company's behavior for you.</p>
<p>Though the RTX 5060 launched on May 19, Nvidia and its partners were uncharacteristically slow to ship graphics cards to reviewers. For outlets that received pre-launch hardware, Nvidia didn’t provide the pre-launch drivers that it usually sends out so that reviewers could run their own tests on the cards, informing reviewers on a call that drivers would be available to them and the public on the 19th.</p>
<p>Except! Nvidia <em>did</em> offer advance drivers to a handful of publications on the condition that they run a few benchmarks that had been pre-selected by Nvidia and that they only report numbers from tests performed with the 50-series new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) setting enabled.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-and-5060-review-putting-the-mid-in-mid-range/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, ahead of the launch of the Switch 2 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">its GameChat communication features</a>, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/privacy-policy/whats-changed/">updated</a> its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a> to note that the company "may also monitor and record your video and audio interactions with other users." Now that the Switch 2 has officially launched, we have a clearer understanding of how the console handles audio and video recorded during GameChat sessions, as well as when that footage may be sent to Nintendo or shared with partners, including law enforcement.</p>
<p>Before using GameChat on Switch 2 for the first time, you must consent to a set of GameChat Terms displayed on the system itself. These terms warn that chat content is "recorded and stored temporarily" both on your system and the system of those you chat with. But those stored recordings are only shared with Nintendo if a user reports a violation of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/community-guidelines/?srsltid=AfmBOoq-mAHbzdcIN7q8kBPONxq-dm5WM2_fFDG_ec16SRZc0dWkz-Xr">Nintendo's Community Guidelines</a>, the company writes.</p>
<p>That reporting feature lets a user "review a recording of the last three minutes of the latest three GameChat sessions" to highlight a particular section for review, suggesting that chat sessions are not being captured and stored in full. The terms also lay out that "these recordings are available only if the report is submitted within 24 hours," suggesting that recordings are deleted from local storage after a full day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-warns-switch-2-gamechat-users-your-chat-is-recorded/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Calling Anthropic two-faced for depicting itself as a "white knight of the AI industry" while allegedly lying about AI scraping, Reddit painted Anthropic as the worst among major AI players. While Anthropic rivals like OpenAI and Google paid Reddit to license data—and, crucially, agreed to "Reddit’s licensing terms that protect Reddit and its users’ interests and privacy" and require AI companies to respect Redditors' deletions—Anthropic wouldn't participate in licensing talks, Reddit alleged.</p>
<p>"Unlike its competitors, Anthropic has refused to agree to respect Reddit users’ basic privacy rights, including removing deleted posts from its systems," Reddit's complaint said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/reddit-sues-anthropic-over-ai-scraping-that-retained-users-deleted-posts/">Read full article</a></p>

On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it.</p>
<p>The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently <a href="https://www.sanmarcostx.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_06032025-4464">proposed</a>, down the road.</p>
<p>“It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees, outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/what-solar-what-wind-texas-data-centers-build-their-own-gas-power-plants/">Read full article</a></p>

      <em>Alien: Earth</em> is set two years before the events of 1979's <em>Alien</em>.

<p>It's been a long wait for diehard fans of Ridley Scott's <em>Alien</em> franchise, but we finally have a fittingly sinister official trailer for the spinoff prequel series, <em>Alien: Earth,</em> coming this summer to FX/Hulu.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/alien-earth-teaser-gives-us-xenomorphs-pov/">previously reported</a>, the official premise is short and sweet: "When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat."</p>
<p>The series is set in 2120, two years before the events of the first film, <em>Alien</em> (1979), in a world where corporate interests are competing to be the first to unlock the key to human longevity—maybe even immortality. Showrunner Noah Hawley <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/noah-hawley-alien-series-prometheus-backstory-not-useful-1235871454/">has said</a> that the style and mythology will be closer to that film than <em>Prometheus</em> (2012) or <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, both of which were also prequels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/fx-hulu-releases-sinister-alien-earth-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/opinion/anthropic-ceo-regulate-transparency.html">argued against</a> a proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation in a New York Times opinion piece, calling the measure shortsighted and overbroad as Congress considers including it in President Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/elon-musk-to-exit-government-upset-that-trump-bill-undermines-doges-work/">tax policy bill</a>. Anthropic makes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Claude</a>, an AI assistant similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>Amodei warned that AI is advancing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">too fast</a> for such a long freeze, predicting these systems "could change the world, fundamentally, within two years; in 10 years, all bets are off."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">we covered</a> in May, the moratorium would prevent states from regulating AI for a decade. A bipartisan group of state attorneys general has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/ai-regulation-ban-meets-opposition-state-attorneys-general-over-risks-us-2025-05-16/">opposed the measure</a>, which would preempt AI laws and regulations recently passed in dozens of states.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/in-10-years-all-bets-are-off-anthropic-ceo-opposes-decade-long-freeze-on-state-ai-laws/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Under the Trump administration, the Food and Drug Administration is eagerly embracing artificial intelligence tools that staff members are reportedly calling rushed, buggy, overhyped, and inaccurate.</p>
<p>On Monday, the FDA publicly announced the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-launches-agency-wide-ai-tool-optimize-performance-american-people">agency-wide rollout of a large language model (LLM) called Elsa</a>, which is intended to help FDA employees—"from scientific reviewers to investigators." The FDA said the generative AI is already being used to "accelerate clinical protocol reviews, shorten the time needed for scientific evaluations, and identify high-priority inspection targets."</p>
<p>"It can summarize adverse events to support safety profile assessments, perform faster label comparisons, and generate code to help develop databases for nonclinical applications," the announcement promised.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/fda-rushed-out-agency-wide-ai-tool-its-not-going-well/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, classic computer collector Joe Strosnider <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/museumjoe.bsky.social/post/3lqq3v43hh52b">announced</a> the availability of a new 3D-printer filament that replicates the iconic "<a href="https://vintagemacmuseum.com/when-the-mac-plus-changed-from-beige-to-platinum/">Platinum</a>" color scheme used in classic Macintosh computers from the late 1980s through the 1990s. The PLA filament (PLA is short for polylactic acid) allows hobbyists to 3D-print nostalgic novelties, replacement parts, and accessories that match the original color of vintage Apple computers.</p>
<p>Hobbyists commonly feed this type of filament into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-my-first-few-months-with-a-bambu-lab-a1-3d-printer-part-1/">commercial desktop 3D printers</a>, which heat the plastic and extrude it in a computer-controlled way to fabricate new plastic parts.</p>
<p>The Platinum color, which Apple used in its desktop and portable computer lines starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS">Apple IIgs</a> in 1986, has become synonymous with a distinctive era of classic Macintosh aesthetic. Over time, original Macintosh plastics have become <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/189/what-happened-to-my-snes-case-discoloration-in-classic-machines">brittle and discolored</a> with age, so matching the "original" color can be a somewhat challenging and subjective experience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/06/new-filament-lets-you-3d-print-parts-in-authentic-1980s-apple-computer-color/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, DC—The general outline of the Trump administration's proposed 2026 budget was released a few weeks back, and it included massive cuts for most agencies, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trumps-2026-budget-proposal-crippling-cuts-for-science-across-the-board/">every one that funds scientific research</a>. Late last week, those agencies began releasing details of what the cuts would mean for the actual projects and people they support. And the results are as bad as the initial budget had suggested: one-of-a-kind scientific experiment facilities and hardware retired, massive cuts in supported scientists, and entire areas of research halted.</p>
<p>And this comes in an environment where previously funded grants are being terminated, funding is being held up for ideological screening, and universities have been subjected to arbitrary funding freezes. Collectively, things are heading for damage to US science that will take decades to recover from. It's a radical break from the trajectory science had been on.</p>
<p>That's the environment that the US's National Academies of Science found itself in yesterday while hosting the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/44894_06-2025_the-state-of-the-science-address-2025">State of the Science</a> event in Washington, DC. It was an obvious opportunity for the nation's leading scientific organization to warn the nation of the consequences of the path that the current administration has been traveling. Instead, the event largely ignored the present to worry about a future that may never exist.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/us-science-is-being-wrecked-and-its-leadership-is-fighting-the-last-war/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a revealing interview published by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YdOjoaQTOQ">the <em>All-In Podcast</em></a> on Wednesday, the private astronaut nominated to lead NASA, Jared Isaacman, spoke at length on what he thought about the nomination process, how he would have led NASA, and the factors that led to the abrupt rescission of his nomination by President Trump.</p>
<p>"I got a call Friday, of last week, that the president has decided to go in a different direction," Isaacman said. "It was a real bummer."</p>
<p>It was a real bummer for most of the space community, myself included. To be clear, I am biased. I have gotten to know Isaacman over the last five years rather well, talking with him about his passion for spaceflight, what is working, and what is not. What I have discovered in Isaacman is a person who cares deeply about the future of US spaceflight and wants to make a meaningful contribution to its advancement. To see him done wrong like this, well, it's a very sordid affair.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/jared-isaacman-speaks-out-and-its-clear-that-nasa-lost-a-visionary-leader/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Two commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission are resigning at the end of this week. For at least a little while, the FCC will have just two members: Chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican chosen by Trump to lead the agency, and Anna Gomez, a Democratic commissioner.</p>
<p>Democrat Geoffrey Starks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-democrat-to-resign-cementing-republican-majority-for-chairman-carr/">announced in March</a> that he would leave in the near future, and <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-411805A1.pdf">today</a> he said that Friday will be his final day. Starks' departure could have given Carr a 2-1 Republican majority, but it turns out Republican Commissioner Nathan Simington will leave at the same time as Starks.</p>
<p>"I will be concluding my tenure at the Federal Communications Commission at the end of this week," Simington <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-411800A1.pdf">announced</a> today. "It has been the greatest honor of my professional life to serve the American people as a Commissioner. I am deeply honored to have been entrusted with this responsibility by President Donald J.
