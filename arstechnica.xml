      They seem so sweet and innocent but these squirrels are also opportunistic killers.

<p>We think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel">squirrels</a> as adorably harmless creatures, admiring their bushy tails and twitchy little noses and the way they cram their cheeks with nuts or seeds to bring back to their nests for later. But the rodents turn out to be a bit more bloodthirsty than we thought. According to a new paper published in the Journal of Ethology, California ground squirrels have been caught in the act—many times over—of chasing, killing, and eating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole">voles</a>.</p>
<p>Co-author Jennifer Smith, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/carnivorous-feeding-squirrels-documented-california">described</a> the behavior as "shocking," given the sheer number of times they watched squirrels do this. “We had never seen this behavior before," <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/carnivorous-feeding-squirrels-documented-california">she said</a>. "Squirrels are one of the most familiar animals to people. We see them right outside our windows; we interact with them regularly. Yet here’s this never-before-encountered-in-science behavior that sheds light on the fact that there’s so much more to learn about the natural history of the world around us.”</p>
<p>Squirrels mainly consume acorns, seeds, nuts, and fruits, but they have been known to supplement that diet with insects and, occasionally, stealing eggs or young hatchlings from nests. And back <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/gbn/vol53/iss2/5/">in 1993</a>, biologist J.R Callahan caused a stir by reporting that as many as 30 species of squirrel could be preying on smaller creatures: namely, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and the occasional small mammal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/watch-carnivorous-squirrels-chow-down-on-tasty-voles/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Teen drug use continued to fall in 2024, extending a dramatic decline spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic that experts expected would reverse now that the acute phase of the global crisis is well over.</p>
<p>But, according to <a href="https://news.umich.edu/missing-rebound-youth-drug-use-defies-expectations-continues-historic-decline/">data released Tuesday</a>, the number of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders who collectively abstained from the use of alcohol, marijuana, or nicotine hit a new high this year. Use of illicit drugs also fell on the whole and use of non-heroin narcotics (Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet) hit an all-time low.</p>
<p>"Many experts in the field had anticipated that drug use would resurge as the pandemic receded and social distancing restrictions were lifted," Richard Miech, team lead of the Monitoring the Future survey at the University of Michigan, said in a statement. "As it turns out, the declines have not only lasted but have dropped further."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/the-kids-are-maybe-alright-teen-drug-use-hits-new-lows-in-ongoing-decline/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Nvidia replaced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/latest-nvidia-drivers-to-be-locked-behind-geforce-experience-app/">the longstanding GeForce Experience App</a> with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">a new, unified Nvidia App</a> last month, most GPU owners probably noted the refresh and rebranding with nothing more than bemusement (though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/nvidias-new-app-doesnt-require-you-to-log-in-to-update-your-gpu-driver/">the new lack of an account login requirement</a> was a nice improvement). Now, testing shows that running the new app with default settings can lead to some significant frame rate dips on many high-end games, even when the app's advanced AI features aren't being actively used.</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/we-tested-nvidia-app-performance-problems-games-run-up-to-15-percent-slower-with-the-app">noted the performance dip</a> after reading reports of related problems around the web. The site's testing with and without the Nvidia App installed confirms that, across five games running on an RTX 4060, the app reduced average frame rates by around 3 to 6 percent, depending on the resolution and graphical quality level.</p>
<p>The site's measured frame rate drop peaked at 12 percent for <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> running at 1080p Ultra settings; other tested games (including <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>, and <em>Stalker 2</em>) showed a smaller drop at most settings.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-new-nvidia-app-is-probably-hurting-your-pc-gaming-performance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>How do you fit 32 terabytes of storage into a hard drive? With a HAMR.</p>
<p>Seagate has been experimenting with heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, since at least 2002. The firm has occasionally popped up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/hamr-time-seagate-demos-terabyte-per-inch-hard-disk-technology/">offer a demonstration</a> or make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/hamr-dont-hurt-em-laser-assisted-hard-drives-are-coming-in-2020/">yet another</a> "around the corner" pronouncement. The press has enjoyed myriad chances to celebrate the wordplay of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer">Stanley Kirk Burrell</a>, but new qualification from large-scale customers might mean HAMR drives will be actually available, to buy, as physical objects, for anyone who can afford the most magnetic space possible. Third decade's the charm, perhaps.</p>
<p>HAMR works on the principle that, when heated, a disk's magnetic materials can hold more data in smaller spaces, such that you can fit more overall data on the drive. It's not just putting a tiny hot plate inside an HDD chassis; as <a href="https://www.seagate.com/www-content/ti-dm/tech-insights/en-us/docs/TP707-1-1712US_HAMR.pdf">Seagate explains in its technical paper</a>, "the entire process—heating, writing, and cooling—takes less than 1 nanosecond." Getting from a physics concept to an actual drive involved adding a laser diode to the drive head, optical steering, firmware alterations, and "a million other little things that engineers spent countless hours developing." Seagate has a lot more about Mozaic 3+ <a href="https://www.seagate.com/innovation/mozaic/">on its site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/after-decades-of-talk-seagate-seems-ready-to-actually-drop-the-hamr-hard-drives/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Return-to-office (RTO) mandates have caused companies to lose some of their best workers, a study tracking over 3 million workers at 54 "high-tech and financial" firms at the S&amp;P 500 index has found. These companies also have greater challenges finding new talent, the report concluded.</p>
<p>The paper, <em>Return-to-Office Mandates and Brain Drain</em> [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/5031481.pdf">PDF</a>], comes from researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, as well as Baylor University, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. The study, which was published in November, spotted this month by human resources publication <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/rto-mandates-lead-to-brain-drain-attrition/734989/">HR Dive,</a> and cites Ars Technica reporting, was conducted by collecting information on RTO announcements and sourcing data from LinkedIn. The researchers said they only examined companies with data available for at least two quarters before and after they issued RTO mandates. The researchers explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>To collect employee turnover data, we follow prior literature ... and obtain the employment history information of over 3 million employees of the 54 RTO firms from Revelio Labs, a leading data provider that extracts information from employee LinkedIn profiles. We manually identify employees who left a firm during each period, then calculate the firm’s turnover rate by dividing the number of departing employees by the total employee headcount at the beginning of the period. We also obtain information about employees’ gender, seniority, and the number of skills listed on their individual LinkedIn profiles, which serves as a proxy for employees’ skill level.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are limits to the study, however. The researchers noted that the study "cannot draw causal inferences based on our setting." Further, smaller firms and firms outside of the high-tech and financial industries may show different results. Although not mentioned in the report, relying on data from a social media platform could also yield inaccuracies, and the number of skills listed on a LinkedIn profile may not accurately depict a worker's skill level.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/companies-issuing-rto-mandates-lose-their-best-talent-study/">Read full article</a></p>

The upgrade is one of a number of new features being rolled out to OpenAI's developer customers starting today.</p>
<p>OpenAI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKABimtOWME">announced during a livestream today</a> that the new o1 model would bring back many of the "core features you've been missing" from the API during o1-preview. This includes the ability to use developer messages to help guide your particular chatbot (i.e. "You are a helpful assistant for tax professionals.") and access to a "reasoning effort" parameter that tells the API how long to think about specific queries, saving time and money on simple problems so they can be used on the tougher ones. API users can also use visual information like scans of documents as input.</p>
<p>OpenAI also highlighted improvements to the new API's use of internal function calling, where the OpenAI model decides to call functions pre-written by outside developers to generate answers to certain queries, when appropriate. The new API is also more accurate in its use of structured outputs, which use a JSON schema to present information in a specific format outlined by the developer, OpenAI said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-api-users-get-full-access-to-the-new-o1-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Rumors have suggested that Nvidia will be taking the wraps off of some next-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards at CES in January. And as we get closer to that date, Nvidia's partners and some of the PC makers have begun to inadvertently leak details of the cards.</p>
<p>According to recent leaks from both Zotac and Acer, it looks like Nvidia is planning to announce four new GPUs next month, all at the high end of its lineup: The RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 were all briefly listed on Zotac's website, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/zotac-confirms-geforce-rtx-5090-with-32gb-gddr7-memory-5080-and-5070-series-listed-as-well">as spotted by VideoCardz</a>. There's also an RTX 5090D variant for the Chinese market, which will presumably have its specs tweaked to conform with current US export restrictions on high-performance GPUs.</p>
<p>Though the website leak didn't confirm many specs, it did list the RTX 5090 as including 32GB of GDDR7, an upgrade from the 4090's 24GB of GDDR6X. An Acer spec sheet for new Predator Orion desktops also lists 32GB of GDDR7 for the 4090, as well as 16GB of GDDR7 for the RTX 5080. This is the same amount of RAM included with the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nvidia-partners-leak-next-gen-rtx-50-series-gpus-including-a-32gb-5090/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court yesterday rejected the broadband industry's challenge to a New York law that requires Internet providers to offer $15- or $20-per-month service to people with low incomes.</p>
<p>In August, six trade groups representing the cable, telecom, mobile, and satellite industries filed a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/isps-new-york-supreme-court.pdf">petition</a> asking the Supreme Court to overturn an appeals court ruling that upheld the state law. But the Supreme Court won't take up the case. The high court denied the telecom groups' petition without comment in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121624zor_6khn.pdf">list of orders</a> released yesterday.</p>
<p>Although a US District Court judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ny-cant-force-isps-to-offer-15-low-income-broadband-plans-judge-rules/">blocked the law</a> in 2021, that judge's ruling was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/court-upholds-new-york-law-that-says-isps-must-offer-15-broadband/">reversed</a> by the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in April 2024. The Supreme Court's denial of the industry petition leaves the 2nd Circuit ruling in place.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/big-loss-for-isps-as-supreme-court-wont-hear-challenge-to-15-broadband-law/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>TikTok has asked the Supreme Court to step in before it's forced to shut down the app in the US next month.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TikTok-Emergency-Injunction-Application-12-16-24.pdf">petition</a> requesting a temporary injunction, TikTok prompted the Supreme Court to block the ban and grant a review that TikTok believes will result in a verdict that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act is unconstitutional. And if the court cannot take up this review before TikTok's suggested January 6 deadline, the court should issue an administrative injunction delaying the ban until after Trump's inauguration, TikTok argued, appearing to seek any path to delay enforcement, even if only by a day.</p>
<p>According to TikTok, it makes no sense to force the app to shut down on January 19 if, the very next day or soon thereafter, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/tiktoks-two-paths-to-avoid-divestiture-beg-scotus-or-woo-trump/">Trump will take office and pause or otherwise intervene with enforcement</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/facing-ban-next-month-tiktok-begs-scotus-for-help/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The fact that Honda was working on a new Prelude coupe was not entirely secret—not after the automaker unveiled a show car at this year's Long Beach Grand Prix. This morning, the Japanese automaker confirmed that the new Prelude will go on sale here in the US late in 2025.</p>
<p>"The return of the Honda Prelude as a hybrid-electric sports model demonstrates our continued commitment to offer a variety of exhilarating products to meet the needs of our customers," said Jessika Laudermilk, assistant vice president of Honda Auto Sales. "The first three products in the Honda lineup in the 1970s were Civic, Accord, and Prelude, and soon all three will be back together again in our passenger car lineup as hybrids."</p>
<p>Honda has often used the two-door Prelude coupe as a testbed for new technologies, including torque vectoring and four-wheel steering, and was praised by the late automotive writer <a href="https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/features/opinion/ljk-setright/ljk-setright-on-hondas-car-archive-september-1985/">LJK Setright</a>, who owned several Preludes across the years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/honda-is-reviving-the-prelude-coupe-this-time-as-a-hybrid/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trumps-fcc-chair-is-brendan-carr-who-wants-to-regulate-everyone-except-isps/">Brendan Carr</a>, wants the FCC to crack down on news broadcasters that he perceives as being unfair to Trump or Republicans in general.</p>
<p>Carr's stated goals would appear to mark a major shift in the FCC's approach to broadcasters. Carr's predecessors, including outgoing Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and Republican Ajit Pai, who served in the first Trump administration, both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-chair-slams-trumps-call-to-revoke-cbs-and-abc-broadcast-licenses/">rejected Trump's calls</a> to punish news networks for alleged bias.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The first batch of Internet satellites for China's Guowang megaconstellation launched Monday on the country's heavy-lift Long March 5B rocket.</p>
<p>The satellites are the first of up to 13,000 spacecraft a consortium of Chinese companies plans to build and launch over the next decade. The Guowang fleet will beam low-latency high-speed Internet signals in an architecture similar to SpaceX's Starlink network, although Chinese officials haven't laid out any specifics, such as target markets, service specifications, or user terminals.</p>
<p>The Long March 5B rocket took off from Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan Island, China's southernmost province, at 5:00 am EST (10:00 UTC) Monday. Ten liquid-fueled engines powered the rocket off the ground with 2.4 million pounds of thrust, steering the Long March 5B on a course south from Wenchang into a polar orbit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/china-orbits-first-guowang-internet-satellites-with-thousands-more-to-come/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Matthew Decker is the former chief information officer for Penn State University’s Applied Research Laboratory. As of October, he's also $250,000 richer.</p>
<p>In his Penn State position, Decker was well placed to see that the university was not implementing all of the cybersecurity controls that were required by its various contracts with NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD). It did not, for instance, use an external cloud services provider that met the DoD's security guidelines, and it fudged some of the self-submitted "scores" it made to the government about Penn State's IT security.</p>
<p>So Decker sued the school under the False Claims Act, which lets private individuals bring cases against organizations on behalf of the government if they come across evidence of wrongdoing related to government contracts. In many of these cases, the government later "intervenes" to assist with the case (as it did here), but whether it does so or not, whistleblowers stand to collect a percentage of any fines if they win.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/in-it-need-cash-cybersecurity-whistleblowers-are-earning-big-payouts/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Correction issued for black plastic study that had people tossing spatulas.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Editors of the environmental chemistry journal Chemosphere have posted an eye-catching correction to a study reporting toxic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524022173">flame retardants from electronics wind up in some household products made of black plastic</a>, including kitchen utensils. The study sparked a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/black-plastic-spatula-health-risks-6fddfdad?mod=e2tw">flurry of media reports</a> a few weeks ago that urgently implored people to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/10/black-plastic-spatula-flame-retardants/680452/">ditch their kitchen spatulas</a> and spoons. Wirecutter even offered a buying guide for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/toxic-black-plastic-kitchen-alternatives/">what to replace them with</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565352402811X">The correction</a>, posted Sunday, will likely take some heat off the beleaguered utensils. The authors made a math error that put the estimated risk from kitchen utensils off by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Specifically, the authors estimated that if a kitchen utensil contained middling levels of a key toxic flame retardant (BDE-209), the utensil would transfer 34,700 nanograms of the contaminant a day based on regular use while cooking and serving hot food. The authors then compared that estimate to a reference level of BDE-209 considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's safe level is 7,000 ng—per kilogram of body weight—per day, and the authors used 60 kg as the adult weight (about 132 pounds) for their estimate. So, the safe EPA limit would be 7,000 multiplied by 60, yielding 420,000 ng per day. That's 12 times more than the estimated exposure of 34,700 ng per day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/huge-math-error-corrected-in-black-plastic-study-authors-say-it-doesnt-matter/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Sony launched the PlayStation Portable almost exactly 20 years ago, the value proposition was right there in the name: a PlayStation, but portable. But now modders have flipped that, introducing a PSP that can be played on a TV, console-style, and they've dubbed it the <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/">PS Placeable</a>.</p>
<p>It's a non-destructive mod to PSP-2000 and PSP-3000 systems that allows you to play PSP games on the TV off the original UMD physical media format, with a wireless controller like the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4—all wrapped in a miniature, PlayStation 2-like enclosure.</p>
<p>Let's be frank: One of the main reasons this thing gets special attention here is that its look is both clever and, well, kind of adorable. The miniaturization of the retro styling of the PlayStation 2 is a nice touch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ps-placeable-the-adorable-mod-that-turns-a-playstation-portable-into-a-console/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hackers trying to extort the Rhode Island government infiltrated the state's public benefits system, causing state officials to shut down online services that let residents apply for Medicaid and other assistance programs.</p>
<p>"As part of this investigation today, we discovered that within the Rhode Island Bridges system, a cybercriminal had installed dangerous malware that constituted an urgent threat," Governor Dan McKee said at a Friday night press conference, <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/politics/state/2024/12/13/rhode-island-computer-network-cyberattack-forces-shutdown-public-benefits-system/76975102007/">according to The Providence Journal</a>. "That is why tonight we have shut down the system. That means customers will temporarily not be able to access any customer portal related to the services on Rhode Island Bridges."</p>
<p>The vendor "Deloitte confirmed that there is a high probability that a cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable information from RIBridges," McKee's office <a href="https://governor.ri.gov/press-releases/governor-mckee-issues-update-cybersecurity-breach-ribridges-system">said</a> in a press release.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released a <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/amazon_investigation.pdf">report</a> accusing Amazon of operating "uniquely dangerous warehouses" that allegedly put profits over worker safety.</p>
<p>As chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Sanders started investigating Amazon in June 2023. His goal was "to uncover why Amazon’s injury rates far exceed those of its competitors and to understand what happens to Amazon workers when they are injured on the job."</p>
<p>According to Sanders, Amazon "sometimes ignored" the committee's requests and ultimately only supplied 285 documents requested. The e-commerce giant was mostly only willing to hand over "training materials given to on-site first aid staff," Sanders noted, rather than "information on how it tracks workers, the quotas it imposes on workers, and the disciplinary actions it takes when workers cannot meet those quotas, internal studies on the connection between speed and injury rates, and the company’s treatment of injured workers."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/bernie-sanders-probe-finds-amazon-hid-worker-injuries-to-prioritize-profits/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile today said it opened registration for the "T-Mobile Starlink" beta service that will enable text messaging via satellites in dead zones not covered by cell towers.</p>
<p>T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-starlink-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">announcement</a> said the service using Starlink's low-Earth orbit satellites will "provid[e] coverage for the 500,000 square miles of land in the United States not covered by earth-bound cell towers." Starlink parent SpaceX has so far launched over 300 satellites with direct-to-cell capabilities, T-Mobile noted.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">registration page</a> says, "We expect the beta to begin in early 2025, starting with texting and expanding to data and voice over time. The beta is open to all T-Mobile postpaid customers for free, but capacity is limited."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/t-mobile-opens-beta-registration-for-starlink-enabled-cell-phone-service/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The incoming Trump administration has even more plans to delay electric vehicle adoption than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/">previously thought</a>. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-team-plans-sweeping-rollback-biden-ev-emissions-policies-2024-12-16/">Reuters</a>, which has seen transition team documents, the Trump team wants to abolish EV subsidies, claw back federal funding meant for EV charging infrastructure, block EV battery imports on national security grounds, and prevent the federal government and the US military from purchasing more EVs.</p>
<p>During the campaign, candidate Trump made repeated references to ending a supposed EV mandate. In fact, policies put in place by current US President Joe Biden only call for 50 percent of all new vehicles to be electrified by 2032 under EPA rules <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/new-epa-rules-would-cut-car-emissions-56-by-2032/">meant to cut emissions by 56 percent from 2026 levels</a>.</p>
<h2>More pollution</h2>
<p>Instead, the new regime will be far more friendly to gas guzzling, as it intends to roll back EPA fuel efficiency standards to those in effect in 2019. This would increase the allowable level of emissions from cars by about 25 percent relative to the current rule set. US new vehicle efficiency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/us-vehicle-fuel-efficiency-effectively-stalled-over-the-last-10-years/">stalled between 2008 and 2019</a>, and it was only once the Biden administration began in 2021 that the EPA started instituting stricter rules on allowable limits of carbon dioxide and other pollutants from vehicle tailpipes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/on-trumps-chopping-block-evs-charger-funding-californias-emissions/">Read full article</a></p>
