              <![CDATA[<p>Federal authorities have charged two Sudanese nationals with running an operation that performed tens of thousands of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against some of the world’s biggest technology companies, as well as critical infrastructure and government agencies.</p>
<p>The service, branded as Anonymous Sudan, directed powerful and sustained DDoSes against Big Tech companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, Riot Games, PayPal, Steam, Hulu, Netflix, Reddit, GitHub, and Cloudflare. Other targets included CNN.com, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, the US departments of Justice, Defense and State, the FBI, and government websites for the state of Alabama. Other attacks targeted sites or servers located in Europe.</p>
<p>Two brothers, Ahmed Salah Yousif Omer, 22, and Alaa Salah Yusuuf Omer, 27, were both charged with one count of conspiracy to damage protected computers. Ahmed Salah was also charged with three counts of damaging protected computers. Among the allegations is that one of the brothers attempted to “knowingly and recklessly cause death.” If convicted on all charges, Ahmed Salah would face a maximum of life in federal prison, and Alaa Salah would face a maximum of five years in federal prison.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/us-prosecutors-take-down-operation-accused-of-35000-ddoses-over-14-months/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[“Tsavo Man-Eaters” killed dozens of people in late 1890s, including Kenya-Uganda Railway workers.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>For several months in 1898, a pair of male lions turned the Tsavo region of Kenya into their own human hunting grounds, killing many construction workers who were building the Kenya-Uganda railway.  A team of scientists has now identified exactly what kinds of prey the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsavo_Man-Eaters">Tsavo Man-Eaters</a>" fed upon, based on DNA analysis of hairs collected from the lions' teeth, according to a <a href="https://cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01240-5">recent paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. They found evidence of various species the lions had consumed, including humans.</p>
<p>The British began construction of a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in March 1898, with Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson leading the project. But mere days after Patterson arrived on site, workers started disappearing or being killed. The culprits: two maneless male lions, so emboldened that they often dragged workers from their tents at night to eat them. At their peak, they were killing workers almost daily—including an attack on the district officer, who narrowly escaped with claw lacerations on his back. (His assistant, however, was killed.)</p>
<p>Patterson finally managed to shoot and kill one of the lions on December 9 and the second 20 days later. The lion pelts decorated Patterson's home as rugs for 25 years before being sold to Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History in 1924. The skins were restored and used to reconstruct the lions, which are now on permanent display at the museum, along with their skulls.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/scientists-found-human-hairs-in-teeth-of-19th-century-lions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Following an investigation, Elon Musk's X has won its fight to avoid gatekeeper status under the European Union's strict competition law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the European Commission (EC) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_24_5324">announced</a> that "X does indeed not qualify as a gatekeeper in relation to its online social networking service, given that the investigation revealed that X is not an important gateway for business users to reach end users."</p>
<p>Since March, X had strongly opposed the gatekeeper designation by arguing that although X connects advertisers to more than 45 million monthly users, it does not have a "significant impact" on the EU's internal market, a case <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202441/DMA_100232_44.pdf">filing</a> showed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/eu-officials-side-with-musk-find-that-x-is-not-as-important-as-facebook-tiktok/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Another nationwide meat recall is underway over <em>Listeria </em>contamination—and its far more formidable than the last.</p>
<p>As of October 15, meat supplier BrucePac, of Durant, Oklahoma, is recalling <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/brucepac-recalls-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due-possible-listeria">11.8 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products</a> after routine federal safety testing found<em> Listeria monocytogenes</em>, a potentially deadly bacterium, in samples of the company's poultry. The finding triggered an immediate recall, which was first issued on October 9. But, officials are still working to understand the extent of the contamination—and struggling to identify the hundreds of potentially contaminated products.</p>
<p>"Because we sell to other companies who resell, repackage, or use our products as ingredients in other foods, we do not have a list of retail products that contain our recalled items," <a href="https://www.brucepac.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Recall-FAQs-Website-101524.pdf">BrucePac said in a statement</a> updated October 15.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/theres-another-massive-meat-recall-over-listeria-and-its-a-doozy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A school district in Massachusetts was sued by a student's parents after the boy was punished for using an artificial intelligence chatbot to complete an assignment.

<p>Jennifer and her husband, Dale, filed the lawsuit in Plymouth County Superior Court, and the case was then moved to US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Defendants include the superintendent, principal, a teacher, the history department head, and the Hingham School Committee.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/student-was-punished-for-using-ai-then-his-parents-sued-teacher-and-administrators/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It will soon be easy to "click to cancel" subscriptions after the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/10/federal-trade-commission-announces-final-click-cancel-rule-making-it-easier-consumers-end-recurring">adopted</a> a final rule on Wednesday that makes it challenging for businesses to opt out of easy cancellation methods.</p>
<p>“Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” FTC chair Lina Khan said in a press release. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.”</p>
<p>The heart of the new rule requires businesses to provide simple ways to cancel subscriptions. Under the rule, any subscription that can be signed up for online must be able to be canceled online. And cancellation paths for in-person sign-ups must be just as easy, offered either by phone or online.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/ftc-click-to-cancel-rule-seeks-to-end-free-trial-traps-sneaky-auto-enrollments/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[What's with the sudden interest in nuclear power among tech titans?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-and-kairos-sign-nuclear-reactor-deal-with-aim-to-power-ai/">Google announced</a> that it had made a power purchase agreement for electricity generated by a small modular nuclear reactor design that hasn't even received regulatory approval yet. Today, it's Amazon's turn. The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) group <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-nuclear-small-modular-reactor-net-carbon-zero">has announced</a> three different investments, including one targeting a different startup that has its own design for small, modular nuclear reactors—one that has not yet received regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Unlike Google's deal, which is a commitment to purchase power should the reactors ever be completed, Amazon will lay out some money upfront as part of the agreements. We'll take a look at the deals and technology that Amazon is backing before analyzing why companies are taking a risk on unproven technologies.</p>
<h2>Money for utilities and a startup</h2>
<p>Two of Amazon's deals are with utilities that serve areas where it already has a significant data center footprint. One of these is Energy Northwest, which is an energy supplier that sends power to utilities in the Pacific Northwest. Amazon is putting up the money for Energy Northwest to study the feasibility of adding small modular reactors to its Columbia Generating Station, which currently houses a single, large reactor. In return, Amazon will get the right to purchase power from an initial installation of four small modular reactors. The site could potentially support additional reactors, which Energy Northwest would be able to use to meet demands from other users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/amazon-the-latest-tech-giant-to-announce-investments-in-nuclear/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Winamp, through its Belgian owner Llama Group, posted the source for its "Legacy Player Code" on September 24 so that developers could "contribute their expertise, ideas, and passion to help this iconic software evolve."</p>
<p>Less than a month later, that <a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop">repository has been entirely deleted</a>, after it either bumped up against or broke its strange hodgepodge of code licenses, seemingly revealed the source code for other non-open software packages, and made a pretty bad impression on the open-source community.</p>
<h2>"Collaborative" licensing</h2>
<p>Winamp's code was made available in late September, but not very open. Under the "<a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme">Winamp Collaborative License (WCL) Version 1.0.1</a>," you may not "distribute modified versions of the software" in source or binary, and "only the maintainers of the official repository are allowed to distribute the software and its modifications." Anyone may contribute, in other words, but only to Winamp's benefit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/winamp-really-whips-open-source-coders-into-frenzy-with-its-source-release/">Read full article</a></p>

The scam ring created attractive female personas for online dating, using unspecified tools to transform their appearances and voices.</p>
<p>Those arrested included six recent university graduates allegedly recruited to set up fake cryptocurrency trading platforms.

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's been exactly one year since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/analogues-hardware-emulated-nintendo-64-fpga-console-will-arrive-in-2024/">the initial announcement of the Analogue 3D</a>, an HD-upscaled, FPGA-powered Nintendo 64 in the tradition of Analogue's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/analogue-nt-a-museum-grade-nes-for-a-museum-grade-price/">long-running line</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/">high-end retro machines</a>. Today, Analogue is revealing more details about the hardware, which will sell for $250 and plans to ship in the first quarter of 2025 (a slight delay from the previously announced 2024 release plan).</p>
<p>Like previous Analogue devices, the Analogue 3D uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to simulate the actual logic gates found in original N64 hardware. That helps ensure 100 percent compatibility with the entire N64 cartridge library across all regions, Analogue promises, and should avoid the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/rp8nbp/why_is_it_often_said_that_n64_is_harder_to/">long-standing accuracy and lag issues</a> inherent to most software-based emulation of the N64.</p>

<p>To get that level of fidelity, the Analogue team spent four years programming an Altera Cyclone FPGA with a full 220,000 logic elements. That's a big step up from previous Analogue devices—the Analogue Pocket's main FPGA board featured just 49,000 logic elements three years ago. But the Analogue Pocket also included a second, 15,000-logic-element FPGA, which allowed it to run <a href="https://openfpga-cores-inventory.github.io/analogue-pocket/">an expanding list</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/analogue-pocket-gets-future-minded-fpga-cores-update-with-mister-in-its-sights/">openFPGA cores</a> to support games from other classic consoles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/250-analogue-3d-will-play-all-your-n64-cartridges-in-4k-early-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Christopher Ren does a solid Elon Musk impression.</p>
<p>Ren is a product manager at Reality Defender, a company that makes tools to combat AI disinformation. During a video call last week, I watched him use some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-tool-enables-real-time-face-swapping-on-webcams-raising-fraud-concerns/">viral GitHub code</a> and a single photo to generate a simplistic deepfake of Elon Musk that maps onto his own face. This digital impersonation was to demonstrate how the startup’s new AI detection tool could work. As Ren masqueraded as Musk on our video chat, still frames from the call were actively sent over to Reality Defender’s custom model for analysis, and the company’s widget on the screen alerted me to the fact that I was likely looking at an <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/deepfakes/">AI-generated deepfake</a> and not the real Elon.</p>
<p><figure class="ars-img-shortcode id-1463183 align-right">

      </figure>
Sure, I never really thought we were on a video call with Musk, and the demonstration was built specifically to make Reality Defender's early-stage tech look impressive, but the problem is entirely genuine. Real-time video deepfakes are a growing threat for governments, businesses, and individuals. Recently, the chairman of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations mistakenly took a video call with someone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/senator-cardin-deepfake.html">pretending to be a Ukrainian official</a>. An international engineering company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/17/uk-engineering-arup-deepfake-scam-hong-kong-ai-video">lost millions of dollars</a> earlier in 2024 when one employee was tricked by a deepfake video call. Also, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/yahoo-boys-real-time-deepfake-scams/">romance scams</a> targeting everyday individuals have employed similar techniques.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/startup-can-catch-identify-deepfake-video-in-realtime/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>You may or may not be excited about some of the new generative AI features, but it has a lot of other things in it, too. And even if you're not in love with Windows or the current trajectory of Windows, there are still plenty of places you need to use it anyway.</p>
<p>We've pulled together all kinds of resources to create a comprehensive guide to installing and upgrading to Windows 11. This includes advice and some step-by-step instructions for turning on officially required features like your TPM and Secure Boot, as well as official and unofficial ways to skirt the system-requirement checks on "unsupported" PCs, because Microsoft is not your parent and therefore cannot tell you what to do.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-whether-your-pc-is-supported-or-not/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon is shaking up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindlefamily">its entire Kindle e-reader lineup</a> today, at least by the slow-moving and relatively placid standards of the e-reader market. The company is announcing a major refresh to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P">pen-centric Kindle Scribe</a>, a screen-size bump for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P">the mainstream Kindle Paperwhite</a>, and small tweaks to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P">the basic Kindle</a>—a rare simultaneous refresh for devices that the company usually updates one or two at a time.</p>
<p>In addition to the monochrome e-readers, Amazon introduced its first color e-reader today. The new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P">Kindle Colorsoft</a>, covered in more detail <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazons-first-color-kindle-e-reader-the-kindle-colorsoft-will-run-you-280">here</a>, looks almost identical to the new Paperwhite and launches on October 30 for $279.99.</p>
<h2>Enhanced e-readers</h2>

<p>Going from most to least significant: The new Kindle Scribe's upgrades are mostly meant to make it a more paper-like writing experience. It has a new textured screen coating, a white screen bezel that blends into the screen (we've also seen this deployed in tablets like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/new-color-e-ink-remarkable-tablet-tries-to-catch-up-with-and-leapfrog-kindle-scribe/">the reMarkable Paper Pro</a>), and a tweaked Premium Pen accessory with a "new soft-tipped eraser" that feels more like an actual pencil eraser.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazon-refreshes-its-monochrome-kindle-lineup-including-a-bigger-paperwhite/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon is overhauling <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindlefamily">its entire Kindle e-reader lineup today</a>. And nestled among the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazon-refreshes-its-black-and-white-kindle-lineup-including-a-bigger-paperwhite">nice-but- straightforward updates</a> to the base model Kindle, the mainstream Kindle Paperwhite, and the pen-centric Kindle Scribe is a first: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P">Kindle Colorsoft</a>, Amazon's first color e-reader.</p>
<p>The Colorsoft will launch on October 30 and starts at $279.99. That's quite a bit higher than the new Kindle Paperwhite, which starts at $159.99, but it's a little less than the $290 launch price of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/review-amazons-kindle-oasis-is-a-pricey-look-at-the-future-of-e-readers/">the now-discontinued Kindle Oasis</a>. The Colorsoft also includes 32GB of storage, wireless charging support, and sensors for automatically adjusting screen brightness and color temperature, all features that are only available in the $200 Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition.</p>
<p>Book covers and illustrations will be displayed in color on the Colorsoft's screen, and it will also support the same color-coded highlighting as the Kindle phone and tablet apps. Monochrome text and images are displayed at 300 PPI, the same as all other devices in the Kindle lineup, while color is displayed at 150 PPI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazons-first-color-kindle-e-reader-the-kindle-colorsoft-will-run-you-280/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Human beings live every day with the understanding of our own mortality, but do animals have any concept of death? It's a question that has long intrigued scientists, fueled by reports of ants, for example, appearing to attend their own"funerals"; chimps gathering somberly around fallen comrades; or a mother whale who carried her dead baby with her for two weeks in an apparent show of grief.</p>
<p>Philosopher Susana Monsó is a leading expert on animal cognition, behavior and ethics at the National Distance Education University (UNED) in Madrid, Spain. She became interested in the topic of how animals experience death several years ago while applying for a grant and noted that there were a number of field reports on how different animal species reacted to death. It's an emerging research field called comparative thanatology, which focuses on how animals react to the dead or dying, the physiological mechanisms that underlie such reactions, and what we can learn from those behaviors about animal minds.</p>
<p>"I could see that there was a new discipline that was emerging that was very much in need of a philosophical approach to help it clarify its main concepts," she told Ars. "And personally, I was turning 30 at the time and became a little bit obsessed with death.  So I wanted to think a lot about death and maybe come to fear it less through philosophical reflection on it."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/what-we-can-learn-from-animals-about-death-and-mortality/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/drug-makers-sue-fda-so-they-can-keep-making-knockoff-weight-loss-drugs/">Facing a lawsuit</a>, the Food and Drug Administration has decided to reconsider its decision to take popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs off of the national shortage list, which will allow compounding pharmacies to continue selling cheaper copycat versions—at least for now.</p>
<p>A trade organization representing compounding pharmacies sued the agency last week over its <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-clarifies-policies-compounders-national-glp-1-supply-begins-stabilize">October 2 announcement</a> that there was no longer a shortage of tirzepatide drugs, branded as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. The products, members of the extremely popular and effective class of GLP-1 drugs, had been on the shortage list since December 2022.</p>
<p>Being on the list meant that compounding pharmacies were legally allowed to make "<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/98964/download">essentially copies</a>" of the products; the only time these pharmacies—also called outsourcing facilities—can make imitation versions of approved drugs, such as tirzepatide, is when the products appear on the shortage list. So, with the FDA's announcement, compounders were immediately barred from making any more of the lucrative drugs and had 60 days to fulfill existing orders.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/drugmakers-can-keep-making-off-brand-weight-loss-drugs-as-fda-backpedals/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is taking a closer look at how broadband data caps affect consumers, and is considering whether it has authority to regulate how Internet service providers impose such caps. Democrats are spearheading the effort over the opposition of the FCC's Republican minority.</p>
<p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel floated a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/fcc-chair-to-investigate-exactly-how-much-everyone-hates-data-caps/">plan to open a formal inquiry</a> into data caps in June 2023, and the FCC is finally moving ahead. A Notice of Inquiry <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-explores-how-broadband-data-caps-impact-competition-and-consumers">announced</a> today "explores how broadband data caps impact competition and consumers," the FCC said.</p>
<p>"During the last year, nearly 3,000 people have gotten so aggravated by data caps on their Internet service that they have reached out the Federal Communications Commission to register their frustration," Rosenworcel said in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-106A2.pdf">statement</a> issued today. "We are listening. Today, we start an inquiry into the state of data caps. We want to shine a light on what they mean for Internet service for consumers across the country."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-republican-opposes-regulation-of-data-caps-with-analogy-to-coffee-refills/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the beginning, North Korean hackers compromised the banking infrastructure running AIX, IBM’s proprietary version of Unix. Next, they hacked infrastructure running Windows. Now, the state-backed bank robbers have expanded their repertoire to include Linux.</p>
<p>The malware, tracked under the name FASTCash, is a remote access tool that gets installed on payment switches inside compromised networks that handle payment card transactions. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency first warned of FASTCash in 2018 in an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2018/10/02/hidden-cobra-fastcash-campaign">advisory</a> that said the malware was infecting AIX-powered switches inside retail payment networks. In 2020, the agency updated its guidance to <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-239a">report</a> FASTCash was now infecting switches running Windows as well. Besides embracing Windows, FASTCash had also expanded its net to include not just switches for retail payments but those handled by regional interbank payment processors as well.</p>
<h2>Tampering with transaction messages on the fly</h2>
<p>Over the weekend, a researcher <a href="https://doubleagent.net/fastcash-for-linux/">reported</a> finding two samples of FASTCash for switches running on Linux. One sample is compiled for Ubuntu Linux 20.04 and was likely developed sometime after April 21, 2022. The other sample was likely not used. As of the time this post went live, only four anti-malware engines <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f34b532117b3431387f11e3d92dc9ff417ec5dcee38a0175d39e323e5fdb1d2c">detected</a> each <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7f3d046b2c5d8c008164408a24cac7e820467ff0dd9764e1d6ac4e70623a1071">sample</a>. The number of detections as of Sunday was zero. The Linux version was uploaded to VirusTotal in June 2023.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/north-korean-hackers-use-newly-discovered-linux-malware-to-raid-atms/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At the University of Toronto, just across the street from the football stadium, workers are putting up a 14-story building with space for classrooms and faculty offices. What’s unusual is how they’re building it — by bolting together giant beams, columns, and panels made of manufactured slabs of wood.</p>
<p>As each wood element is delivered by flatbed, a tall crane lifts it into place and holds it in position while workers attach it with metal connectors. In its half-finished state, the building resembles flat-pack furniture in the process of being assembled.</p>
<p>The tower uses a new technology called mass timber. In this kind of construction, massive, manufactured wood elements that can extend more than half the length of a football field replace steel beams and concrete. Though still relatively uncommon, it is growing in popularity and beginning to pop up in skylines around the world.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/sustainable-building-effort-reaches-new-heights-with-wooden-skyscrapers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>SpaceX said it is seeking "several small-but-meaningful updates to the orbital configuration and operational parameters for its Gen2 space station authorization to improve space sustainability, better respond to evolving demand, and more efficiently share spectrum with other spectrum users."</p>
<p>SpaceX wants to lower the altitudes of satellites "at 525 km, 530 km, and 535 km to 480 km, 485 km, and 475 km altitude, respectively."
