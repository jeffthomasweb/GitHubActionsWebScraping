<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the federal body that sets technology standards for governmental agencies, standards organizations, and private companies, has proposed barring some of the most vexing and nonsensical password requirements. Chief among them: mandatory resets, required or restricted use of certain characters, and the use of security questions.</p>
<p>Choosing strong passwords and storing them safely is one of the most challenging parts of a good cybersecurity regimen. More challenging still is complying with password rules imposed by employers, federal agencies, and providers of online services. Frequently, the rules—ostensibly to enhance security hygiene—actually undermine it. And yet, the nameless rulemakers impose the requirements anyway.</p>
<h2>Stop the madness, please!</h2>
<p>Last week, NIST released <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html">SP 800-63-4</a>, the latest version of its Digital Identity Guidelines. At roughly 35,000 words and filled with jargon and bureaucratic terms, the document is nearly impossible to read all the way through and just as hard to understand fully. It sets both the technical requirements and recommended best practices for determining the validity of methods used to authenticate digital identities online. Organizations that interact with the federal government online are required to be in compliance.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052508#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052508&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An overwhelming majority of Amazon employees are “dissatisfied” with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/amazon-kills-remote-working-tells-workers-to-be-in-office-5-days-a-week/">Amazon killing remote work </a>and requiring them to be in the office five days a week next year. That's according to a survey of 2,585 employees by Blind, an online community where verified employees can discuss their work culture anonymously.</p>
<p>Since May, Amazon employees have been able to work remotely up to twice per week—a policy that Amazon has reportedly enforced by keeping track of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=amazon+badge+tracking&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS981US981&amp;oq=amazon+badge+tracking&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhA0gEIMjIxMmowajSoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">badge swipes</a> and how many hours workers spend in offices.</p>
<p>On September 16, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent a memo to employees stating that Amazon would require most workers to come into the office five days a week at the start of 2025. "We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective,” the memo said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052484#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052484&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>New York is facing an unusual boom in mosquitoes toting the deadly eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, which has already led to one rare death in the state and a declaration of an "imminent threat" by officials.</p>
<p>While the state's surveillance system typically picks up EEE-positive mosquitoes in two or three counties each year, this year there have been 15 affected counties, which are scattered all across New York, State Health Commissioner James McDonald <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-statewide-action-following-confirmed-case-eastern-equine">said this week</a>.</p>
<p>"Eastern equine encephalitis is different this year," McDonald said, noting the deadly nature of the infection, which has a mortality rate of between 30 and 50 percent. "Mosquitoes, once a nuisance, are now a threat," McDonald added. "I urge all New Yorkers to prevent mosquito bites by using insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothing, and removing free-standing water near their homes. Fall is officially here, but mosquitoes will be around until we see multiple nights of below-freezing temperatures."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052463#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052463&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI Chief Technical Officer Mira Murati <a href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027">announced</a> she is leaving the company in a surprise resignation shared on the social network X. Murati joined OpenAI in 2018, serving for six-and-a-half years in various leadership roles, most recently as the CTO.</p>

<p>"After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAI," she wrote in a letter to the company's staff. "While I'll express my gratitude to many individuals in the coming days, I want to start by thanking Sam and Greg for their trust in me to lead the technical organization and for their support throughout the years," she continued, referring to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman. "There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right."</p>
<p>At OpenAI, Murati was in charge of overseeing the company's technical strategy and product development, including the launch and improvement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/when-ai-images-were-mind-blowing-early-users-recall-the-first-days-of-dall-e-2/">DALL-E</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/">Codex</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">Sora</a>, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> platform, while also leading research and safety teams. In public appearances, Murati often spoke about ethical considerations in AI development.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052426#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052426&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

"We realize we need more time to polish and refine the experience, pushing further some of our key features," Côté wrote. "As such, we've made the decision to postpone the release date."</p>
<p>He went on to promise a same-day launch on Steam as well as the console platforms for that date.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052423#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052423&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In May, when OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">first demonstrated</a> ChatGPT-4o's coming audio conversation capabilities, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/is-the-world-ready-for-an-ai-assistant-that-can-laugh-in-your-face/">I wrote</a> that it felt like we were "on the verge of something... like a sea change in how we think of and work with large language models." Now that those "Advanced Voice" features are <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1838642444365369814">rolling out widely to ChatGPT subscribers</a>, we decided to ask ChatGPT to explain, in its own voice, how this new method of interaction might impact our collective relationship with large language models.</p>
<p>That chat, which you can listen to and read a transcript of below, shouldn't be treated as an interview with an official OpenAI spokesperson or anything. Still, it serves as a fun way to offer an initial test of ChatGPT's live conversational chops.</p>
<figure class="video ars-wp-video">
    <div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;">

    </figure>
<p>Even in this short introductory "chat," we were impressed by the natural, dare-we-say human cadence and delivery of ChatGPT's "savvy and relaxed" Sol voice (which reminds us a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qr6BUNYQJE">'90s Janeane Garofalo</a>). Between ChatGPT's ability to give quick responses—offered in in milliseconds rather than seconds—and convincing intonation, it's incredibly easy to fool yourself into thinking you're speaking to a conscious being rather than what is, as ChatGPT says here, "still just a computer program processing information, without real emotions or consciousness."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052409#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052409&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Among the first AI companies that the Federal Trade Commission has exposed as deceiving consumers is DoNotPay—which initially was advertised as "the world's first robot lawyer" with the ability to "sue anyone with the click of a button."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes">announced</a> that it took action to stop DoNotPay from making bogus claims after learning that the AI startup conducted no testing "to determine whether its AI chatbot’s output was equal to the level of a human lawyer." DoNotPay also did not "hire or retain any attorneys" to help verify AI outputs or validate DoNotPay's legal claims.</p>
<p>DoNotPay accepted no liability. But to settle the charges that DoNotPay violated the FTC Act, the AI startup agreed to pay $193,000, if the FTC's consent agreement is confirmed following a 30-day public comment period. Additionally, DoNotPay agreed to warn "consumers who subscribed to the service between 2021 and 2023" about the "limitations of law-related features on the service," the FTC said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052417#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052417&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cox Communications asked a court to block Rhode Island's plan for distributing $108.7 million in federal funding for broadband deployment. If successful, Cox's lawsuit could prevent other Internet service providers from obtaining grants to expand into areas that Cox says it already serves with high-speed broadband.</p>
<p>The cable company claims Rhode Island used "flawed Internet speed data" to determine which areas are underserved and that the plan "will benefit wealthy parts of the State already served with high-speed Internet in contravention of the program that it purports to implement."</p>
<p>Cox filed the <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cox-v-rhode-island.pdf">lawsuit</a> on Monday in Superior Court in Providence, Rhode Island. It seeks an injunction prohibiting Rhode Island from using the allegedly flawed speed test data to determine where broadband grants should be directed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052401#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052401&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Thus far, Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meta-continues-to-shovel-money-into-the-growing-vr-gaming-segment/">heavily money-losing Reality Labs division</a> has been primarily focused on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">bulky virtual reality headsets</a> (and some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/even-people-who-bought-metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-dont-want-to-use-them/">odd, display-free Ray-Ban branded sunglasses</a>). So when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pulled out a 100 g pair of see-through, augmented-reality glasses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091">at this year's Meta Connect keynote</a>, it represented a bit of a new direction for the company.</p>
<p>The prototype Orion AR glasses Zuckerberg showed off today don't mean Meta will be ready to release a pair of consumer AR glasses anytime soon. But the demo represents a new vision for lightweight, wide-ranging, see-through smartglasses that Zuckerberg calls "a glimpse of the future" and "the dream of Reality Labs."</p>
<h2>Not your average screen</h2>
<p>The core challenge of building a pair of comfortable augmented-reality glasses, Zuckerberg said, is that "they have to be glasses." That means no bulky headset (a la Quest), no wires (a la Apple Vision Pro), and a weight of less than 100 grams (compared to a full 515 g for the Meta Quest 3). While there's a tiny battery and "custom silicon" in those lightweight glasses, Zuckerberg admitted that some processing is done in a "small puck" that connects wirelessly to the glasses themselves.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052383#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052383&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two things can be true for Intel's new Core Ultra 200-series processors, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/intel-announces-first-batch-of-second-gen-lunar-lake-core-ultra-laptop-cpus/">codenamed Lunar Lake</a>: They can be both impressive and embarrassing.</p>
<p>Impressive because they perform reasonably well, despite some regressions and inconsistencies, and because they give Intel's battery life a much-needed boost as the company competes with new Snapdragon X Elite processors from Qualcomm and Ryzen AI chips from AMD. It will also be Intel's first chip to meet Microsoft's performance requirements for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">Copilot+ features in Windows 11</a>.</p>
<p>Embarrassing because, to get here, Intel had to use another company's manufacturing facilities to produce a competitive chip.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052298#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052298&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last month, Ars Technica went on a deep dive into the rapid growth of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/">ads in TV software</a>. Less than three weeks later, LG announced that it was adding advertisements to its TVs’ screensavers. The move embodies how ads are a growing and virtually inescapable part of the TV-viewing experience—even when you're not watching anything.</p>
<p>As you might have expected, LG didn’t make a big, splashy announcement to consumers or LG TV owners about this new ad format. Instead, and ostensibly strategically, the September 5 announcement was made to advertisers. LG appears to know that screensaver ads aren't a feature that excites users. Still, it and many other TV makers are happy to shove ads into the software of already-purchased devices.</p>
<p>LG TV owners may have already spotted the ads or learned about them via <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1727255253">FlatpanelsHD</a>, which today reported seeing a full-screen ad on the screensaver for LG's latest flagship TV, the G4. “The ad appeared before the conventional screensaver kicks in," per the website, “and was localized to the region the TV was set to.” (You can see images that FlatpanelsHD provided of the ads <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/lgscreensaverad_5.jpg">here</a>, <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/lgscreensaverad_2_large.jpg">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/lgscreensaverad_1_large.jpg">here</a>.) The reviewer reported seeing an ad for LG’s free ad-supported streaming channel, LG Channels, as well as third-party ads.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052278#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052278&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI hopes to convince the White House to approve a sprawling plan that would place 5-gigawatt AI data centers in different US cities, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-24/openai-pitched-white-house-on-unprecedented-data-center-buildout">reports</a>.</p>
<p>The AI company's CEO, Sam Altman, supposedly pitched the plan after a recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/12/readout-of-white-house-roundtable-on-u-s-leadership-in-ai-infrastructure/">meeting</a> with the Biden administration where stakeholders discussed AI infrastructure needs. Bloomberg reviewed an OpenAI document outlining the plan, reporting that 5 gigawatts "is roughly the equivalent of five nuclear reactors" and warning that each data center will likely require "more energy than is used to power an entire city or about 3 million homes."</p>
<p>According to OpenAI, the US needs these massive data centers to expand AI capabilities domestically, protect national security, and effectively compete with China. If approved, the data centers would generate "thousands of new jobs," OpenAI's document promised, and help cement the US as an AI leader globally.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052285#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052285&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>At a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091">Connect conference keynote</a> today, Meta officially unveiled <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/">the Quest 3S headset</a>, a cheaper version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">last year's Quest 3</a>. The new spin-off device will be available in stores Oct. 15 for a price starting at $300 (for 128GB of storage).</p>
<p>That lower price for the Quest 3S comes with a few compromises compared to its predecessor. The biggest is the display, an LCD panel which matches the 1832x1920 per eye resolution of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/review-we-do-not-recommend-the-299-oculus-quest-2-as-your-next-vr-system/">2020's Quest 2</a>. That should be a noticeable downgrade from the two 2064×2208 pixel LCD displays on the Quest 3. The 3S also mirrors the Quest 2's use of fresnel lenses, a downgrade from the pancake lenses on the Quest 3 which <a href="https://blogs.expandreality.io/pancake-lenses-vs-fresnel-lenses-whats-the-difference">allowed for improved clarity and less bulky lens housing</a>.</p>
<p>The Quest 3S also promises just a 96 degree horizontal field of view, down from 110 degrees on the Quest 3, and 90 degrees of vertical field of view, down from 96 degrees on the Quest 3. That should lead to a noticeable, relative "tunnel vision" effect that requires a lot more head movement to center an object in your VR vision.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052290#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052290&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Many avid bicyclists these days have hopped onto the "everesting" bandwagon, in which one rides up and down the same mountain route over and over until the total distance of one's ascents matches the elevation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest">Mount Everest</a>: 8,848 meters or about 5.5 miles. Recently there has been debate over whether a strong tailwind could help a rider improve their time. But apparently that's not the case, according to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0131679">new paper</a> published in the American Journal of Physics by physicist Martin Bier of East Carolina University in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The term "everesting" takes its name from George Mallory, grandson of the legendary 1920s mountaineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory">George Mallory</a> who participated in the first three British Everest expeditions. Mallory the younger was prepping for his Everest attempt in 1994, and his training included weekend workouts involving bicycling up Mount Donna Buang in Australia many times until he had achieved the elevation of Mount Everest.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, another Australian cycling enthusiast, Andy van Bergen, started organizing worldwide "everesting" events. Participating cyclists would pick a hill near their homes and track each other's progress online. The events became extremely popular in 2020 after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic sparked global lockdowns.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051157#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051157&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/on-self-driving-waymo-is-playing-chess-while-tesla-plays-checkers/">controversial</a> "Full Self Driving" is now capable of some quite advanced driving. But that can breed undeserved complacency, according to independent testing. The partially automated driving system exhibited dangerous behavior that required human intervention more than 75 times over the course of more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of driving in Southern California, averaging one intervention every 13 miles (21 km).</p>
<p>AMCI Testing evaluated FSD builds 12.5.1 and then 12.5.3 across four different environments: city streets, rural two-lane highways, mountain roads, and interstate highways. And <a href="https://amcitesting.com/tesla-fsd/">as its videos show</a>, at times FSD was capable of quite sophisticated driving behavior, like pulling into a gap between parked cars to let an oncoming vehicle through, or moving left to give space to pedestrians waiting at a crosswalk for the light to change. AMCI also praised FSD for how it handled blind curves out in the countryside.</p>
<p>"It's undeniable that FSD 12.5.1 is impressive, for the vast array of human-like responses it does achieve, especially for a camera-based system," said Guy Mangiamele, director of AMCI Testing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052261#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052261&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google has filed an antitrust complaint in Brussels against Microsoft, alleging its Big Tech rival engages in unfair cloud computing practices that has led to a reduction in choice and an increase in prices.</p>
<p>The US search giant has accused Microsoft of leveraging its Windows software to lock customers into its Azure cloud services, preventing them from easily switching to alternatives.</p>
<p>In a complaint sent to the European Commission, seen by the Financial Times, Google said Microsoft is “exploiting” its customers’ reliance on products such as its Windows software by imposing “steep penalties” on using rival cloud providers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052251#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052251&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've been sleeping on the Akira Kurosawa-inspired, <em>Assassin's Creed</em>-esque samurai game <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, you've been missing out. Given that it recently got a PC release, this is a great time to catch up on it—but now there's even more reason to do so, as Sony just announced a sequel titled <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>.</p>
<p>Slated for a 2025 release, the game bears similarities to its predecessor. It follows a wandering samurai who rides horses across picturesque, wind-swept fields, befriends animals, and defeats enemies in katana duels.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>was set on Tsushima Island during the time of the Mongol invasion, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is (fittingly) set around the foot of Mount Yōtei, one of Japan's most picturesque locales—the area is called Hokkaido today.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052227#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052227&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When security researcher Johann Rehberger recently reported a vulnerability in ChatGPT that allowed attackers to store false information and malicious instructions in a user’s long-term memory settings, OpenAI summarily closed the inquiry, labeling the flaw a safety issue, not, technically speaking, a security concern.</p>
<p>So Rehberger did what all good researchers do: He created a proof-of-concept exploit that used the vulnerability to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. OpenAI engineers took notice and issued a partial fix earlier this month.</p>
<h2>Strolling down memory lane</h2>
<p>The vulnerability abused long-term conversation memory, a feature OpenAI began testing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/amnesia-begone-soon-chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-tell-it-between-sessions/">in February</a> and made more broadly available <a href="https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/">in September</a>. Memory with ChatGPT stores information from previous conversations and uses it as context in all future conversations. That way, the LLM can be aware of details such as a user’s age, gender, philosophical beliefs, and pretty much anything else, so those details don’t have to be inputted during each conversation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052198#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052198&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Caroline Ellison was sentenced Tuesday to 24 months for her role in covering up <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/ftx-fraudster-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-to-25-years-in-prison/">Sam Bankman-Fried's rampant fraud</a> at FTX—which caused <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/ftx-to-pay-12-7b-to-victims-of-sam-bankman-frieds-massive-scheme/">billions in customer losses</a>.</p>

<p>"I participated in a criminal conspiracy that ultimately stole billions of dollars from people who entrusted their money with us," Ellison reportedly said while sniffling.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, Stability AI <a href="https://stability.ai/news/james-cameron-joins-stability-ai-board-of-directors">announced</a> that renowned filmmaker James Cameron—of <em>Terminator</em> and Skynet fame—has joined its board of directors. Stability is best known for its pioneering but highly controversial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a> series of AI image-synthesis models, first launched in 2022, which can generate images based on text descriptions.</p>

<p>"I’ve spent my career seeking out emerging technologies that push the very boundaries of what’s possible, all in the service of telling incredible stories," said Cameron in a statement. "I was at the forefront of CGI over three decades ago, and I’ve stayed on the cutting edge since. Now, the intersection of generative AI and CGI image creation is the next wave."</p>
<p>Cameron is perhaps best known as the director behind blockbusters like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>Titanic</em>, and <em>Aliens</em>, but in AI circles, he may be most relevant for the co-creation of the character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a>, a fictional AI system that triggers nuclear Armageddon and dominates humanity in the <em>Terminator</em> media franchise. Similar fears of AI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/">taking over the world</a> have since jumped into reality and recently sparked attempts to regulate existential risk from AI systems through measures like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/08/as-contentious-california-ai-safety-bill-passes-critics-push-governor-for-veto/">SB-1047</a> in California.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052114#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052114&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
