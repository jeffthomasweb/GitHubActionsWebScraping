            <![CDATA[The first Trump administration tried this, and Congress passed a rule to block it. ]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/new-nih-policy-will-slash-support-money-to-research-universities/">announced a sudden change</a> to how it handles the indirect costs of research—the money that pays for things like support services and facilities maintenance. These costs help pay universities and research centers to provide the environment and resources all their researchers need to get research done. Previously, these had been set through negotiations with the university and audits of the spending. These averaged roughly 30 percent of the value of the grant itself and would frequently exceed 50 percent.</p>
<p>The NIH announcement set the rate at 15 percent for every campus. The new rate would start today and apply retroactively to existing grants, meaning most research universities are currently finding themselves facing catastrophic budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>Today, a coalition of 22 states <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.280590/gov.uscourts.mad.280590.1.0.pdf">filed a suit</a> that seeks to block the new policy, alleging it violated both a long-standing law and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_(legislation)">budget rider</a> that Congress had passed in response to a 2017 attempt by Trump to drastically cut indirect costs. The suit seeks to prevent the new policy or its equivalent from being applied—something that Judge Angel Kelley of the District of Massachusetts <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25517849-nihtro021025/#document/p2">granted later in the day</a>. The injunction only applies to research centers located in the states that have joined the suit, however, essentially leaving red states to suffer the consequences of the funding cut.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/twenty-two-states-sue-to-block-new-nih-funding-policy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is entering the final stages of designing its long-rumored AI processor with the aim of decreasing the company's dependence on Nvidia hardware, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-set-finalize-first-custom-chip-design-this-year-2025-02-10/">Reuters report</a> released Monday. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> creator plans to send its chip designs to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) for fabrication within the next few months, but the chip has not yet been formally announced.</p>
<p>The OpenAI chip's full capabilities, technical details, and exact timeline are still unknown, but the company reportedly intends to iterate on the design and improve it over time, giving it leverage in negotiations with chip suppliers—and potentially granting the company future independence with a chip design it controls outright.</p>
<p>In the past, we've seen other tech companies, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/microsoft-launches-custom-chips-to-accelerate-its-plans-for-ai-domination/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/amazon-ready-to-use-its-own-ai-chips-reduce-its-dependence-on-nvidia/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/09/google-building-ai-chips-axion-amin-vahdat-nvidia-h100-intel-gaudi-3/">Google</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-debuts-new-generation-ai-chip-2024-04-10/">Meta</a>, create their own AI acceleration chips for reasons that range from cost reduction to relieving shortages of AI chips supplied by Nvidia, which enjoys a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/nvidias-dominance-puts-ai-industry-in-dire-danger-groups-warn-doj/">near-market monopoly</a> on high-powered GPUs (such as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Blackwell series</a>) for data center use.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/openais-secret-weapon-against-nvidia-dependence-takes-shape/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first-ever National Nature Assessment—which was based on significant public feedback and strove to reveal how nature loss influences climate change and impacts humanity—may still see the light of day after the Trump administration abruptly ended the ambitious project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers involved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/climate/nature-assessment-trump.html">told The New York Times</a> that the nature report was "too important to die" and that an "amazingly broad consensus" remains among its mostly volunteer authors, so the expansive report must be completed and released to the public.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first draft of the report was due on Tuesday, so the bulk of the initial work appears mostly done. Although the webpage for the project has been deleted, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250124141504/https:/www.globalchange.gov/our-work/national-nature-assessment">archived</a> version shows that researchers had expected to spend the rest of 2025 seeking external review and edits before releasing the final report in late 2026.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/after-trump-killed-a-report-on-nature-researchers-push-ahead-with-release/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile yesterday <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-starlink-beta-open-for-all-carriers">announced</a> more details of its new service powered by Starlink and said Verizon and AT&amp;T customers can use the satellite offering, too. The standard price will be $15 a month as an add-on for T-Mobile customers, and $20 a month for people who don't have T-Mobile as their primary carrier.</p>
<p>While we've written numerous articles about the Starlink/T-Mobile collaboration over the past two and a half years, the service's beta test and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLw6ZovMpLI">Super Bowl commercial</a> are raising awareness that it exists. In this article we'll answer some questions you might have about T-Mobile Starlink (yes, T-Mobile Starlink is the official name of the service).</p>
<h3>What is this thing anyway?</h3>
<p>Over the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/spacex-launches-first-starlink-satellites-that-will-work-with-t-mobile-phones/">past 13 months</a>, SpaceX's Starlink division has launched about 450 Direct to Cell satellites that can provide service to mobile phones in areas where there are no cell towers. Starlink is partnering with cellular carriers in multiple countries, and T-Mobile is its primary commercial partner in the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/t-mobile-expands-starlink-texting-service-to-cover-verizon-and-att-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Here we (maybe) go again: Reports from a handful of early adopters of Nvidia's new GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card are reporting that their power cables are melting (so far, there's at least one report on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7HaVRUN9k">YouTube</a> and one on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1ilhfk0/rtx_5090fe_molten_12vhpwr/">Reddit</a>, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">reported</a> by The Verge). This recalls a similar situation from early in the RTX 4090's life cycle, when power connectors were melting and even catching fire, damaging the GPUs and power supplies.</p>
<p>After much investigation and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/testing-suggests-faulty-cable-may-be-to-blame-for-melting-rtx-4090-connectors/">many guesses</a> from Nvidia and other testers, the 4090's power connector issues ended up being blamed on what was essentially user error; the 12VHPWR connectors were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/new-test-shows-loose-rtx-4090-power-connectors-cause-overheating-and-melting/">not being inserted all the way into the socket on the GPU</a> or were being bent in a way that created stress on the connection, which caused the connectors to run hot and eventually burst into flames.</p>
<p>The PCI-SIG, the standards body responsible for the design of the new connector, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/pci-standards-group-deflects-assigns-blame-for-melting-gpu-power-connectors/">claimed</a> that the design of the 12VHPWR connector itself was sound and that any problems with it should be attributed to the manufacturers implementing the standard. Partly in response to the 4090 issues, the 12VHPWR connector was replaced by an updated standard <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/diy-builder/power-supply-units/evolving-standards-12vhpwr-and-12v-2x6/?srsltid=AfmBOorP8rameX-x07huylv7or9W6p_d1KvzTOyN4FaR7OPDdptRqxV_">called 12V-2x6</a>, which uses the same cables and is pin-compatible with 12VHPWR, but which tweaked the connector to ensure that power is only actually delivered if the connectors are firmly seated. The RTX 50-series cards use the 12V-2x6 connector.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/handful-of-users-claim-new-nvidia-gpus-are-melting-power-cables-again/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[The state is much more permissive than California for driverless vehicles.]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you live or drive in Austin, Texas, you might start seeing some new-looking Teslas on your roads later this summer. Tesla says it wants to start <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-robotaxis-by-june-musk-turns-texas-hands-off-regulation-2025-02-10/">offering rides for money</a> in the two-seater "Cybercab" that the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/">revealed last year at a Hollywood backlot</a>. California might be the place with enough glitz to unleash that particular stock-bumping news to the world, but the Golden State is evidently far too restrictive for a company like Tesla to truck with. Instead, the easygoing authorities in Texas provide a far more attractive environment when it comes to putting driverless rubber on the road.</p>
<p>During the early days of its autonomous vehicle (AV) ambitions, Tesla did its testing in California, like most of the rest of the industry. California was early to lay down laws and regulations for the nascent AV industry, a move that some criticized as premature and unnecessarily restrictive. Among the requirements has been the need to report <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/01/self-diving-car-companies-hand-over-data-on-glitches-and-failures-to-the-dmv/">test mileage and disengagements</a>, reports that revealed that Tesla's testing has in fact been <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/02/27/tesla-reports-fully-autonomous-miles-first-time-years/">extremely limited</a> within that state's borders <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-full-500-mile-single-charge-test-timelapse/">since 2016</a>.</p>
<p>Other states, mostly ones blessed with good weather, have become a refuge for AV testing away from California's strictures, especially car-centric cities like Phoenix, Arizona, and Austin, Texas. Texas amended its transportation code in 2017 to allow autonomous vehicles to operate on its roads, and it took away any ability for local governments to restrict testing or deployment. By contrast, companies like Waymo and the now-shuttered Cruise were given <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/robotaxis-get-ok-to-charge-for-rides-in-san-francisco/">much more narrow permission</a> to deploy only in limited parts of California.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/tesla-turns-to-texas-to-test-its-autonomous-cybercab/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>While writing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">a wide-ranging history of Windows <em>Minesweeper</em></a> for Boss Fight Books in 2023, I ended up playing many variations of Microsoft's beloved original game. Those include <a href="https://illarn.itch.io/hexasweeper">versions with hexagonal tiles</a>, <a href="https://stingby12.itch.io/my-very-epic-custom-minesweeper-variants">versions with weird board shapes</a>, and versions that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787980/4D_Minesweeper/">extend <em>Minesweeper</em> into four dimensions</a> or <a href="http://gravitation3d.com/xezlec/">more</a>, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Almost all these variants messed a little too much with the careful balance of simplicity, readability, reasoning, and luck that made the original <em>Minesweeper</em> so addictive. None of them became games I return to day after day.</p>
<p>But then I stumbled onto <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper"><em>Dragonsweeper</em></a>, a free browser-based game that <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/">indie developer Daniel Benmergui</a> released unceremoniously on itch.io last month. In the weeks since I discovered it, the game has become my latest puzzle obsession, filling in a worrying proportion of my spare moments with its addictive, simple RPG-tinged take on the <em>Minesweeper</em> formula.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/dragonsweeper-is-my-favorite-game-of-2025-so-far/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Board member Jochen Goller said the group remained optimistic about sales of petrol and plug-in hybrids in the US even if demand for EVs slowed over the next few years on the back of policy changes under the new administration.</p>
<p>“I think it would be naive to believe that the move towards electrification is a one-way road.

              <![CDATA[<p>CenturyLink hasn't broken its annoying habit of leaving customers without service for weeks or months and repeatedly failing to show up for repair appointments.</p>
<p>We've written about CenturyLink's failure to fix long outages several times in the past year and a half. In each case, desperate customers contacted Ars because the telecom provider didn't reconnect their service. And each time, CenturyLink finally sprang into action and fixed the problems shortly after hearing from an Ars reporter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it keeps happening, and CenturyLink (also known as Lumen) can't seem to explain why. In only the last two months, we heard from CenturyLink customers in three states who were without service for periods of between three weeks and over four months.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/centurylink-nightmares-users-keep-asking-ars-for-help-with-multi-month-outages/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Since <em>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out</em> was first released on the NES in 1987, millions of players have undertaken millions more digital matches against <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/100-hardest-video-game-bosses-ranked.html">one of the hardest video game bosses ever</a>—Tyson himself (or, later, <a href="https://punchout.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Dream">the reskinned "Mr. Dream"</a>). Only a small percentage of those players could survive Tyson's flurry of instant-knockdown uppercuts and emerge victorious with the undisputed World Video Boxing Association championship. <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/525246-mike-tysons-punch-out/53884982">Even fewer</a> had fast enough fingers to <a href="https://www.showbizpizza.com/tomspunchout/strat-tyson.html">take out Tyson in the first round</a>.</p>
<p>In all this time, no one has been able to register a TKO on Tyson in less than two minutes on the ever-present in-game clock (which runs roughly three times as quickly as a real-time clock). At least, that was true until this weekend, when popular speedrunner and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SummoningSalt">speedrun historian</a> Summoning Salt <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2376320266">pulled off a 1:59.97 knockout</a> after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpCXiO7eRyw">what he says</a> was "75,000 attempts over nearly 5 years."</p>

      Summoning Salt's record-setting sub-2:00 run.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h2>Incredibly good and incredibly lucky</h2>
<p>Breaking the storied 2:00 barrier on Tyson is a matter of both incredible skill and incredibly unlikely luck. As Summoning Salt himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt1DFNSNbRk">started documenting in a 2017 video</a>, getting the quickest possible Tyson TKO requires throwing 21 "frame perfect" punches throughout the fight, each within a 1/60th of a second window. Punch too early and those punches do slightly less damage, making the fight take just a bit longer. Too late and Tyson will throw up a block, negating the punch entirely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/punch-outs-mike-tyson-has-been-defeated-in-under-two-minutes-for-the-first-time/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Transportation has ordered states to kill their implementation plans related to the <a href="https://driveelectric.gov/state-plans">National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure</a> program, according to a memo obtained by WIRED that was later <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/resources/state-plan-approval-suspension.pdf">made public</a>. The decision appears to halt in its tracks a $5 billion program designed to fund state projects to install electric vehicle charging stations across the United States.</p>
<p>Officials at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which manages the program, ordered state transportation directors to “decertify” the <a href="https://driveelectric.gov/state-plans">plans that all 50 states</a> have used to outline where and how they will build their charging stations, and with what companies they’ll contract to do so. States have followed those plans to build more than 30 charging stations across the US, with hundreds more on the way.</p>
<p>Surveys show prospective car buyers cite the country’s lagging electric vehicle charging infrastructure as a major reason they won’t buy electric. The NEVI program, established by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/four-fast-chargers-every-50-miles-us-unveils-ev-infrastructure-plan/">2021’s Infrastructure Law</a>, was the government’s answer to those concerns. It attempts to build chargers along thousands of miles of federal highway, with a focus on places that might not otherwise be able to financially support a charger.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2025/02/feds-putting-the-kibosh-on-national-ev-charging-program/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Grants paid by the federal government have two components. One covers the direct costs of performing the research, paying for salaries, equipment, and consumables like chemicals or enzymes. But the government also pays what are called indirect costs. These go to the universities and research institutes, covering the costs of providing and maintaining the lab space, heat and electricity, administrative and HR functions, and more.</p>
<p>These indirect costs are negotiated with each research institution and average close to 30 percent of the amount awarded for the research. Some institutions see indirect rates as high as half the value of the grant.</p>
<p>On Friday, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html">announced</a> that negotiated rates were ending. Every existing grant, and all those funded in the future, will see the indirect cost rate set to just 15 percent. With no warning and no time to adjust to the change in policy, this will prove catastrophic for the budget of nearly every biomedical research institution.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/new-nih-policy-will-slash-support-money-to-research-universities/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's the year 2000 all over again, because I've just spent the past week playing <em>The Sims</em>, a game that could have had a resurgent zeitgeist moment if only EA, the infamous game publisher, had put enough effort in.</p>
<p>A few days ago, EA re-released two of its most legendary games: <em>The Sims</em> and <em>The Sims 2</em>. Dubbed the "The Legacy Collection," these could not even be called remasters. EA just put the original games on Steam with some minor patches to make them a little more likely to work on some modern machines.</p>
<p>The emphasis of that sentence should be on the word "some." Forums and Reddit threads were flooded with player comments, saying the game either wouldn't launch at all, crashed shortly after launch, or had debilitating graphical issues. (Patches have been happening, but there's work to be done yet.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-sims-re-release-shows-whats-wrong-with-big-publishers-and-single-player-games/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The primary contractor for the Space Launch System rocket, Boeing, is preparing for the possibility that NASA cancels the long-running program.</p>
<p>On Friday, with less than an hour's notice, David Dutcher, Boeing's vice president and program manager for the SLS rocket, scheduled an all-hands meeting for the approximately 800 employees working on the program. The apparently scripted meeting lasted just six minutes, and Dutcher didn't take questions.</p>
<p>During his remarks, Dutcher said Boeing's contracts for the rocket could end in March and that the company was preparing for layoffs in case the contracts with the space agency were not renewed. "Cold and scripted" is how one person described Dutcher's demeanor.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/boeing-has-informed-its-employees-that-nasa-may-cancel-sls-contracts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Health officials in Texas are battling a growing measles outbreak in an area that has some of the state's lowest vaccination rates and highest non-medical exemptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://southplainshealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/second-case-2025-01-31.pdf">On January 30</a>, officials reported two measles cases in unvaccinated, school-age children in Gaines County, which sits at the border of New Mexico and is around 90 miles southwest of Lubbock, Texas. Both children were hospitalized in Lubbock and had been discharged.</p>
<p>As of midday February 7, the outbreak total reached nine confirmed measles cases in the <a href="https://southplainshealth.org/measles-exposure-page/">South Plains Public Health District</a> (SPPHD) that includes Gaines, according to Zach Holbrooks, executive director for SSPHD. In an interview with Ars, Holbrooks reported that there were three additional probable cases that are linked to the confirmed cases. These are cases in the same household or family—maybe a cousin or sibling—that are showing measles symptoms but haven't been tested yet or gotten their test results back yet, Holbrooks said. So far, there have been no other reports of hospitalizations besides those in the first two cases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-erupts-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, a New York-based app developer named Isaac Gemal debuted a new site called <a href="https://wikitok.vercel.app/">WikiTok,</a> where users can vertically swipe through an endless stream of Wikipedia article stubs in a manner similar to the interface for video-sharing app TikTok.</p>
<p>It's a neat way to stumble upon interesting information randomly, learn new things, and spend spare moments of boredom without reaching for an algorithmically addictive social media app. Although to be fair, WikiTok is addictive in its own way, but without an invasive algorithm tracking you and pushing you toward the lowest-common-denominator content. It's also thrilling because you never know what's going to pop up next.</p>
<p>WikiTok, which works through mobile and desktop browsers, feeds visitors a random list of Wikipedia articles—culled from the Wikipedia API—into a vertically scrolling interface. Despite the name that hearkens to TikTok, there are currently no videos involved. Each entry is accompanied by an image pulled from the corresponding article. If you see something you like, you can tap "Read More," and the full Wikipedia page on the topic will open in your browser.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/new-wikitok-web-app-allows-infinite-tiktok-style-scroll-of-wikipedia/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There are only two licensed professional sports games included in Wikipedia's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_notable_for_negative_reception">List of video games notable for negative reception</a>." Do not be fooled, however: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_2K20">WWE 2K20</a></em> and <em>eFootball 2022</em> are just the outliers, arriving so poorly crafted as to cause notable outcry and an actual change to development plans. Most licensed professional sports games come out yearly, whether fully baked, notably improved, or not, and fans who have few other options to play with their favorite intellectual property learn to make do with them.</p>
<p>Not so with fans of <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/">Football Manager</a>, a series that can be traced back in some form to 1992 that has released a game almost every year, minus one ownership shift in the early 2000s. Sports Interactive, the company behind the franchise, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">released a statement on Thursday</a> (in British time) that says that "following extensive internal discussions and careful consideration," <em>Football Manager 25 </em>is canceled. The game was "too far away from the standards you deserve," so they are focusing on the 2026 version.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education (DOE) was <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UC-Student-Association-v-DOE-Complaint-2-7-25.pdf">sued</a> Friday by a California student association demanding an "immediate stop" to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) "unlawfully" digging through student loan data to potentially dismantle DOE.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"The scale of the intrusion into individuals’ privacy is enormous and unprecedented," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the University of California Student Association (UCSA)—which has over 230,000 undergraduate students as members—more than 42 million people in the US have federal student loans and face privacy risks, if DOGE's access to their information isn't blocked. Additionally, parents and spouses of loan borrowers share private financial information with the DOE that could also be at risk, the lawsuit alleged.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/lawsuit-tries-to-block-doges-access-to-student-loan-data/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The United Kingdom issued a secret order requiring Apple to create a backdoor for government security officials to access encrypted data, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">The Washington Post reported today</a>, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>UK security officials "demanded that Apple create a backdoor allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud," the report said. "The British government's undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies."</p>
<p>Apple and many privacy advocates have repeatedly criticized government demands for backdoors to encrypted systems, saying they would harm security and privacy for all users. Backdoors developed for government use would inevitably be exploited by criminal hackers and other governments, security experts have said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/uk-demands-apple-break-encryption-to-allow-govt-spying-worldwide-reports-say/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[New method exploits a ladder-climbing glitch, emulator tools, and a bit of luck.]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0923752/">the 2007 documentary <em>King of Kong</em></a> or followed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/billy-mitchell-vs-twin-galaxies/">the controversy surrounding score-chaser Billy Mitchell</a>, you know all about <em>Donkey Kong</em>'s famous kill screen. For over four decades, no one was able to pass the game's 117th screen (aka level 22-1) due to a glitch in the game's bonus timer that kills Mario well before he can reach the top of the stage's girders.</p>
<p>That was true until last weekend, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoTQ53iM8c0">Mario speedrunner Kosmic shared the news</a> that he had passed the kill screen using a combination of frame-perfect emulator inputs, a well-known ladder movement glitch, and a bit of luck. And even though Kosmic's trick is functionally impossible to pull off with human reflexes on real hardware, the method shows how the game's seemingly insurmountable kill screen actually can be overcome without modifying the code on an official <em>Donkey Kong</em> arcade board.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CoTQ53iM8c0?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div><div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300">

<h2>Breaking the broken ladder</h2>
<p><em>Donkey Kong</em>'s kill screen is a side effect of the limited 8-bit register the game uses when calculating the two largest digits of a level's Bonus Timer (which doubles as the overall timer for each screen). At level 22, this calculation makes the register overflow past 256 and back down to 4, giving Mario just a few seconds to complete the stage before instant death.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/donkey-kongs-famed-kill-screen-has-been-cleared-for-the-first-time/">Read full article</a></p>
