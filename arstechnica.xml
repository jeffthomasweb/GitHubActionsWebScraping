                            <![CDATA[<p>Nearly half of the databases that public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were updating on a monthly basis have been frozen without notice or explanation, according to a<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04022"> study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The study—led by Janet Freilich, a law expert at Boston University, and Jeremy Jacobs, a medical professor at Vanderbilt University—examined the status of all CDC databases, finding a total of 82 that had, as of early 2025, been receiving updates at least monthly. But, of those 82, only 44 were still being regularly updated as of October 2025, with 38 (46 percent) having their updates paused without public notice or explanation.</p>
<p>Examining the databases' content, it appeared that vaccination data was most affected by the stealth data freezes. Of the 38 outdated databases, 33 (87 percent) included data related to vaccination. In contrast, none of the 44 still-updated databases relate to vaccination. Other frozen databases included data on infectious disease burden, such as data on hospitalizations from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-lets-cdc-vaccination-data-rot-dozens-of-databases-frozen/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>However, experts say that TikTok users' censorship fears are justified, whether the bugs are to blame or not.</p>
<p>Ioana Literat, an associate professor of technology, media, and learning at Teachers College, Columbia University, has studied TikTok's politics since the app first shot to popularity in the US in 2018. She told Ars that "users' fears are absolutely justified" and explained why the "bugs" explanation is "insufficient."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-claimed-bugs-blocked-anti-ice-videos-epstein-mentions-experts-call-bs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There are reports that a legitimate Microsoft email address—which Microsoft explicitly says customers should add to their allow list—is delivering scam spam.</p>
<p>The emails originate from no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com, an address tied to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/">Power BI</a>. The Microsoft platform provides analytics and business intelligence from various sources that can be integrated into a single dashboard. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/end-user-subscribe?tabs=creator">Microsoft documentation</a> says that the address is used to send subscription emails to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/end-user-subscribe#use-group-email-aliases">mail-enabled security groups</a>. To prevent spam filters from blocking the address, the company advises users to add it to allow lists.</p>
<h2>From Microsoft, with malice</h2>
<p>According to an Ars reader, the address on Tuesday sent her an email claiming (falsely) that a $399 charge had been made to her. It provided a phone number to call to dispute the transaction. A man who answered a call asking to cancel the sale directed me to download and install a remote access application, presumably so he could then take control of my Mac or Windows machine (Linux wasn’t allowed). The email, captured in the two screenshots below, looked like this:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/theres-a-rash-of-scam-spam-coming-from-a-real-microsoft-address/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court is taking up a case on whether Paramount violated the 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) by disclosing a user's viewing history to Facebook. The case, <em>Michael Salazar v. Paramount Global</em>, hinges on the law's definition of the word "consumer."</p>
<p>Salazar filed a class action against Paramount in 2022, alleging that it "violated the VPPA by disclosing his personally identifiable information to Facebook without consent," Salazar's <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-459/379417/20251010164519322_25-%20_______Petition%20for%20Writ.pdf">petition</a> to the Supreme Court said. Salazar had signed up for an online newsletter through 247Sports.com, a site owned by Paramount, and had to provide his email address in the process. Salazar then used 247Sports.com to view videos while logged in to his Facebook account.</p>
<p>"As a result, Paramount disclosed his personally identifiable information—including his Facebook ID and which videos he watched—to Facebook," the petition said. "The disclosures occurred automatically because of the Facebook Pixel Paramount installed on its website. Facebook and Paramount then used this information to create and display targeted advertising, which increased their revenues."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/supreme-court-to-decide-how-1988-videotape-privacy-law-applies-to-online-video/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of NASA's three large WB-57 aircraft made an emergency landing at Ellington Field on Tuesday morning in southeastern Houston.</p>
<p>Video captured by KHOU 11 television showed the aircraft touching down on the runway without its landing gear extended. The pilot then maintains control of the vehicle as it slides down the runway, slowing the aircraft through friction. The crew was not harmed, NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens said.</p>

<p>"Today, a mechanical issue with one of NASA’s WB-57s resulted in a gear-up landing at Ellington Field," she said. "Response to the incident is ongoing, and all crew are safe at this time. As with any incident, a thorough investigation will be conducted by NASA into the cause. NASA will transparently update the public as we gather more information."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/one-of-nasas-three-wb-57-aircraft-just-did-a-belly-landing-in-houston/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>LG Flex customers can sign up for one-, two-, or three-year subscriptions to get lower monthly payments.</p>
<p>“At the end of your subscription, you can apply for a free upgrade, keep paying monthly, or return your device,” the LG Flex website says.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and death. These can be the consequences for vulnerable kids who get addicted to social media, according to more than 1,000 personal injury lawsuits that seek to punish Meta and other platforms for allegedly prioritizing profits while downplaying child safety risks for years.</p>
<p>Social media companies have faced scrutiny before, with congressional hearings <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/zuckerberg-says-sorry-for-meta-harming-kids-but-rejects-payments-to-families/">forcing CEOs to apologize</a>, but until now, they've never had to convince a jury that they aren't liable for harming kids.</p>
<p>This week, the first high-profile lawsuit—considered a "bellwether" case that could set meaningful precedent in the hundreds of other complaints—goes to trial. That lawsuit documents the case of a 19-year-old, K.G.M, who hopes the jury will agree that Meta and YouTube caused psychological harm by designing features like infinite scroll and autoplay to push her down a path that she alleged triggered depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicidality.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-settles-hours-before-landmark-social-media-addiction-trial-starts/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Large swathes of the US were blanketed in snow and ice over the weekend, and what better way to spend a snow day than going down a YouTube rabbit hole? Everyone has their favorite oddity: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI78AdiI6f7VKhqW1i4B3Rw">ASMR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCORIeT1hk6tYBuntEXsguLg">jazzy pop song covers</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JKenjiLopezAlt">cooking channels</a>, or what have you. But <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/11u5sl2/best_home_improvementdiy_youtube_channels/">DIY enthusiasts</a> in particular are missing out if they're not watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DrainCleaningAUSTRALIA">Drain Cleaning Australia</a>, featuring an Australian plumber known only as Bruce as he goes about his daily business of shooting high-powered water jets into stubborn clogged drainage systems. It's "the YouTube channel you never knew you needed." And it's done so well that he's now launched a second channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BruceThePlumber">Bruce the Plumber</a>.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon the Drain Cleaning Australia channel via <a href="https://goldenglobes.com/articles/good-hang-with-amy-poehler-wins-the-first-golden-globe-for-best-podcast/">Amy Poehler</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWlStkhTVME"><em>Good Hang</em> podcast episode</a> with Kate McKinnon, who is a big fan and does a dead-on delivery of Bruce's trademark lines ("You little rippah!"). Bruce never appears in his videos, apart from his hands and the occasional shadow as he films various challenging jobs with his intrepid smartphone. He seems to have struck a good balance between online popularity and protecting his personal privacy. (Bruce did not respond to our interview request. It's okay, mate, we know all those drains Down Under aren't going to unclog themselves.)</p>
<p>Armed with his trusty collection of jet nozzles and "Mister Plungey," Bruce has removed all manner of nasty things from drains over the years: masses of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJPemhzgbi8">human hair</a> from shower drains; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP6iUsoNVIQ">tree roots</a>; plastic bags and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ATNSkGF3Y">other refuse</a> that somehow found their way into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5yujBXuDNY">drainage systems</a>; and the less said about the many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOcdelK02bI">clogged toilets</a>, the better.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/australian-plumber-is-a-youtube-sensation/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It can be hard sometimes to keep up with the deluge of generative AI in Google products. Even if you try to avoid it all, there are some features that still manage to get in your face. Case in point: AI Overviews. This AI-powered search experience has a reputation for getting things wrong, but you may notice some improvements soon. Google says AI Overviews is being upgraded to the latest <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/">Gemini 3 models</a> with a more conversational bent.</p>
<p>In just the last year, Google has radically expanded the number of searches on which you get an AI Overview at the top. Today, the chatbot will almost always have an answer for your query, which has relied mostly on models in Google's Gemini 2.5 family. There was nothing wrong with Gemini 2.5 as generative AI models go, but Gemini 3 is a little better by every metric.</p>
<p>There are, of course, multiple versions of Gemini 3, and Google doesn't like to be specific about which ones appear in your searches. What Google does say is that AI Overviews chooses the right model for the job. So if you're searching for something simple for which there are a lot of valid sources, AI Overviews may manifest something like Gemini 3 Flash without running through a ton of reasoning tokens. For a complex "long tail" query, it could step up the thinking or move to Gemini 3 Pro (for paying subscribers).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/ai-overviews-gets-upgraded-to-gemini-3-with-a-dash-of-ai-mode/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Volvo provided flights from Austin, Texas, to Stockholm, Sweden, and accommodation so Ars could learn about its new seatbelt. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>With the launch of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/heres-volvos-new-ex60-60000-electric-midsize-suv/">all-new, all-electric EX60</a>, Volvo has put lessons learned from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/driving-the-volvo-ex30-a-36k-ev-that-prioritizes-sustainability/">EX30</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-volvo-ex90-a-low-key-luxury-electric-suv/">EX90</a> to use. The EX60 is built on Volvo’s new SPA3 platform, made only for battery-electric vehicles. It boasts up to 400 miles (643 km) of range, with fast-charging capabilities Volvo says add 173 miles (278 km) in 10 minutes. Mega casting reduces the number of parts of the rear floor from 100-plus to one piece crafted of aluminum alloy, reducing complexities and weld points.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, however, the real achievement is Volvo’s new multi-adaptive safety belt. Volvo has a history with the modern three-point safety belt, which was perfected by in-house engineer Nils Bohlin in 1959 before the patent was shared with the world. Today at the Volvo Cars Safety Center lab, at least one brand-new Volvo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/in-1959-volvo-gave-us-the-seat-belt-heres-what-its-safety-team-is-building-now/">is crashed</a> every day in the name of science. The goal: to test not just how well its vehicles are protecting passengers but what the next frontier is in safety technology.</p>
<p>Senior Safety Technical Leader Mikael Ljung Aust is a driving behavior specialist with 20 years under his belt at Volvo. He says it’s easy to optimize testing toward one person or one test point and come up with a good result. However, both from the behavioral perspective and from physics, people are different. What’s not different, he points out, is how people drive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/how-volvos-new-adaptive-seat-belts-will-reduce-injuries-during-a-crash/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Apple stops supporting older iPhones and iPads with the latest version of iOS or iPadOS, it usually isn't the end of the line—Apple keeps releasing new security-only patches for those devices for another year or two, keeping them usable while their hardware is still reasonably capable.</p>
<p>Once those updates dry up, it's rare for Apple to revisit those older operating systems, but the company does sometimes make exceptions. That was the case yesterday, when the company released a batch of updates for long-retired iOS and iPadOS versions that otherwise hadn't seen a new patch in months or years. Those updates include iOS 12.5.8, available for devices as old as 2013's iPhone 5S and 2014's iPhone 6; iOS 15.8.6, available for devices like the iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPad Air 2; and iOS 16.7.13, available for devices like the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.</p>
<p>Both iOS 15 and iOS 16 were last patched in mid-2025, but iOS 12's last patch was released in January 2023.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/apple-patches-ancient-ios-versions-to-keep-imessage-facetime-other-services-working/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Gen. Michael Guetlein, the senior officer in charge of the US military's planned Golden Dome missile defense shield, has laid out an audacious schedule for deploying a network of space-based sensors and interceptors by the end of President Donald Trump's term in the White House.</p>
<p>The three-year timeline is aggressive, with little margin for error in the event of budget or technological setbacks. The shield is designed to defend the US homeland against a range of long-range weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), cruise missiles, and newer threats like hypersonic weapons and drones.</p>
<p>"By the summer of '28, we will be able to defend the entire nation against ballistic missiles, as well as other generation aerial threats, and we will continue to grow that architecture through 2035," Guetlein said Friday in a presentation to representatives from the US defense industry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/trade-wars-muzzle-allied-talks-on-trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">IMSA provided accommodation so Ars could attend its symposium and the Rolex 24. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.—The annual 24-hour race that kicks off the American racing season took place this past weekend at Daytona International Speedway. Each year, the crowd gets bigger and bigger, drawn in large part by the hybrid prototypes that contest the GTP class for overall victory. After Formula 1, these are some of the most complex, sophisticated race cars ever to turn a wheel—and it doesn't hurt that they look extremely cool, too. But yet again, endurance racing wants to offer more than just entertainment.</p>
<p>A large number of automotive technologies or safety features that we mostly take for granted today <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/10-ways-that-porsches-race-cars-made-road-cars-better/">made their way into road cars from the race track</a>. Seatbelts, rear-view mirrors, turbocharged engines, aerodynamics, direct-injection engines, dual-clutch gearboxes, and more owe their existence to competition. Although <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/11/the-golden-age-tech-speeds-from-racetrack-to-road-faster-than-ever/">direct examples of racing technology transfer</a> in the mid-21st century seem less common than the intangible benefits gained when a bunch of motorsports-trained engineers have lunch every day with their road car colleagues.</p>
<p>That is starting to change, though, and now the domain is in simulation. Vast amounts of data are generated during the course of a race—each of the 11 GTP cars that raced at Daytona collects 1,600 different channels of data from onboard sensors, with nearly as many on the GTD machines that are based on road-going cars like Porsche's 911 or Chevrolet's Corvette. With 60 cars running for 24 hours—and that's just the first race of the year—that's a heck of a lot of high-quality data being generated, and now IMSA wants to leverage that to help automotive and technology companies develop better simulation tools, with the creation of IMSA Labs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/why-nasa-imsa-and-tech-companies-are-teaming-up-on-tech-transfer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For close to a century, geoscientists have pondered a mystery: Where did Earth’s lighter elements go? Compared to amounts in the Sun and in some meteorites, Earth has less hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, as well as noble gases like helium—in some cases, more than 99 percent less.</p>
<p>Some of the disparity is explained by losses to the solar system as our planet formed. But researchers have long suspected that something else was going on too.</p>
<p>Recently, a team of scientists reported a possible explanation—that the elements are hiding deep in the solid inner core of Earth. At its super-high pressure—360 gigapascals, 3.6 million times atmospheric pressure—the iron there behaves strangely, becoming an electride: a little-known form of the metal that can suck up lighter elements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/meet-the-mysterious-electrides/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A company that seeks to disrupt the way in which data from space is received and transmitted has found some key investors and customers.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning Northwood Space announced that it has closed a $100 million Series B round of funding to support a rapid ramp-up in the deployment of its phased-array radar system, known as Portal. The company also said it has received a $49.8 million contract from the US Space Force to augment the Satellite Control Network, which provides telemetry and tracking for the military's satellites.</p>
<p>"We made our last fundraise announcement in April of 2025, so less than a year, but there's been a lot of activity and progress on the Northwood side that reflects the importance of ground as an enabler for pushing forward more capable missions on shorter timelines," said Bridgit Mendler, co-founder and CEO of Northwood, during a media roundtable. "That's why we're here, that's why we're building what we're building, is because we believe that there's a lot of important capability in space that needs to be built faster, and the way to do that is through a vertically integrated ground network."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/as-data-from-space-spikes-an-innovative-ground-station-company-seeks-to-cash-in/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, OpenAI engineer Michael Bolin <a href="https://openai.com/index/unrolling-the-codex-agent-loop/">published</a> a detailed technical breakdown of how the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-introduces-codex-its-first-full-fledged-ai-agent-for-coding/">Codex CLI</a> coding agent works internally, offering developers insight into AI coding tools that can write code, run tests, and fix bugs with human supervision. It complements our article <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">in December</a> on how AI agents work by filling in technical details on how OpenAI implements its "agentic loop."</p>
<p>AI coding agents are having something of a "ChatGPT moment," where Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and Codex with GPT-5.2 have reached a new level of usefulness for rapidly coding up prototypes, interfaces, and churning out boilerplate code. The timing of OpenAI's post details the design philosophy behind Codex just as AI agents are becoming more practical tools for everyday work.</p>
<p>These tools aren't perfect and remain controversial for some software developers. While OpenAI has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">previously told</a> Ars Technica that it uses Codex as a coding tool to help develop the Codex product itself, we also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/">discovered</a>, through hands-on experience, that these tools can be astonishingly fast at simple tasks but remain brittle beyond their training data and require human oversight for production work. The rough framework of a project tends to come fast and feels magical, but filling in the details involves tedious debugging and workarounds for limitations the agent cannot overcome on its own.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/openai-spills-technical-details-about-how-its-ai-coding-agent-works/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The chair of a federal vaccine advisory panel under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made his stance clear on vaccines in a podcast last week—and that stance was so alarming that the American Medical Association was compelled to respond with a scathing statement.</p>
<p>Kirk Milhoan, who was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/meet-cdcs-new-lead-vaccine-advisor-who-thinks-shots-cause-heart-disease/">named chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices</a> for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in December, appeared on the aptly named podcast "<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-conversation-w-dr-kirk-milhoan-chair-of-acip-on/id1788335471?i=1000746190751">Why Should I Trust You</a>." In the hour-long interview, Milhoan made a wide range of comments that have concerned medical experts and raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>Early into the discussion, Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist, declared, "I don't like established science," and that "science is what I observe." He lambasted the evidence-based methodology that previous ACIP panels used to carefully and transparently craft vaccine policy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/do-we-really-need-polio-shots-deep-thoughts-by-rfk-jr-advisor-get-dragged/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>From the Department of Bizarre Anomalies: Microsoft has suppressed an unexplained anomaly on its network that was routing traffic destined to example.com—a domain reserved for testing purposes—to a maker of electronics cables located in Japan.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2606">RFC2606</a>—an official standard maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force—example.com isn't obtainable by any party. Instead it resolves to IP addresses assigned to Internet Assiged Names Authority. The designation is intended to prevent third parties from being bombarded with traffic when developers, penetration testers, and others need a domain for testing or discussing technical issues. Instead of naming an Internet-routable domain, they are to choose example.com or two others, example.net and example.org.</p>
<h2>Misconfig gone, but is it fixed?</h2>
<p>Output from the terminal command cURL shows that devices inside Azure and other Microsoft networks have been routing some traffic to subdomains of sei.co.jp, a domain belonging to Sumitomo Electric. Most of the resulting text is exactly what’s expected. The exception is the JSON-based response.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple is introducing a new version of its AirTag tracking device—simply dubbed "the new AirTag"—and claims it offers substantial improvements thanks to a new Bluetooth chip.</p>
<p>The original AirTag came out five years ago now, and it became popular in a variety of contexts. There were some problems, though—there was real concern about unwanted tracking and stalking with the devices, based on real stories of it being used for that. The company gradually introduced new features and protections against that, getting it to a much better place.</p>
<p>This new version is focused on making the device more effective in general. Thanks to the inclusion of the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip (the same one found in other recently released Apple devices like the iPhone 17), Apple says the new AirTag can work with the Precision Finding feature in the Find My app to direct users to the AirTag (and whatever lost item it's stored with or attached to) from up to 50 percent farther away.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/apple-introduces-new-airtag-with-better-range-and-a-louder-speaker/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Transportation apparently thinks it's a good idea to use artificial intelligence to draft rules impacting the safety of airplanes, cars, and pipelines, a ProPublica investigation <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-artificial-intelligence-google-gemini-transportation-regulations">revealed</a> Monday.</p>
<p>It could be a problem if DOT becomes the first agency to use AI to draft rules, ProPublica pointed out, since AI is known to confidently get things wrong and hallucinate fabricated information. Staffers fear that any failure to catch AI errors could result in flawed laws, leading to lawsuits, injuries, or even deaths in the transportation system.</p>
<p>But the DOT's top lawyer, Gregory Zerzan, isn't worried about that, December meeting notes revealed, because the point isn't for AI to be perfect. It's for AI to help speed up the rulemaking process, so that rules that take weeks or months to draft can instead be written within 30 days. According to Zerzan, DOT's preferred tool, Google Gemini, can draft rules in under 30 minutes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/wildly-irresponsible-dots-use-of-ai-to-draft-safety-rules-sparks-concerns/">Read full article</a></p>
