                            <![CDATA[<p>Pharmaceutical executives are finally saying how they really feel about the extreme anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been ruthlessly implementing—and it's not pretty.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-14/drugmakers-vent-vaccine-anger-during-jpmorgan-health-conference">reporting from Bloomberg</a> at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference that ended today in San Francisco, pharmaceutical executives who had previously been careful to avoid criticizing the Trump administration appear to have reached a breaking point, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla offering some of the most candid comments.</p>
<p>"I am very annoyed. I'm very disappointed. I'm seriously frustrated," Bourla said. "What is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda which is political, and then antivax."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/big-pharma-is-openly-railing-against-rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-agenda/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The New York Times has published new details about a purported cyberattack that unnamed US officials claim plunged parts of Venezuela into darkness in the lead-up to the capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p>Key among the new details is that the cyber operation was able to turn off electricity for most residents in the capital city of Caracas for only a few minutes, though in some neighborhoods close to the military base where Maduro was seized, the outage lasted for three days. The cyber-op also targeted Venezuelan military radar defenses. The paper said the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Cyber_Command">US Cyber Command</a> was involved.</p>
<h2>Got more details?</h2>
<p>“Turning off the power in Caracas and interfering with radar allowed US military helicopters to move into the country undetected on their mission to capture Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president who has now been brought to the United States to face drug charges,” the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/us/politics/cyberattack-venezuela-military.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ElA.iDRW.2t0IQViABMN5&amp;smid=url-share">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/unnamed-officials-tell-nyt-precise-cyber-op-took-out-venezuelas-power-grid/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth"><em>This post contains some mild spoilers, mostly from the beginning of the first episode.</em></aside>
<p>Today is a good day to watch television. That's because the first two episodes of <em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em> hit the Paramount+ streaming service, becoming the newest addition to the long-running Star Trek franchise. It's set in the late 32nd century, 120 years after the burn that ended all warp travel, and with it, most of Starfleet in the process. Now that warp travel is once again possible—you'll have to watch <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/star-trek-discovery/">Discovery's</a></em> final three seasons for more on that—the Federation is putting itself back together, and that includes reopening Starfleet Academy.</p>
<p>That means this show is about young people in space, like Caleb Mir (Sandro Rosta), who was separated from his mother by Starfleet as a child, 15 years earlier. Mir and his mother, played by Tatiana Maslany, were traveling with a pirate—Nus Braka, played by a scenery-chewing Paul Giamatti—who killed a Federation officer while stealing food for them. The first episode opens on Braka and the Mirs being apprehended by Starfleet. Despite her misgivings, Captain Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter) carries out her order to separate mother and child. She's to go to a rehabilitation colony, he's to become a ward of the Federation and go to school on Bajor.</p>
<p>At least that's the plan until he escapes a few minutes later. Then we jump forward 15 years. Ake is teaching on Bajor, having retired from the Federation, ashamed of what she'd done. Admiral Vance (Oded Fehr) shows up and asks her to become commandant at the newly reopened academy in San Francisco; for the past few decades, new recruits have been trained instead by the War College. But Starfleet needs explorers now, and having a rival school means they can show up at some point to challenge some of the show's protagonists to a Parrises Squares tournament.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/star-trek-starfleet-academy-tries-something-different-and-i-dont-hate-it/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The early homecoming culminated in an on-target splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at 12:41 am PST (08:41 UTC) inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The splashdown occurred minutes after the Dragon capsule streaked through the atmosphere along the California coastline, with sightings of Dragon's fiery trail reported from San Francisco to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Four parachutes opened to slow the capsule for the final descent. Zena Cardman, NASA's commander of the Crew-11 mission, radioed SpaceX mission control moments after splashdown: "It feels good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams who got us there and back."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-first-ever-medical-evacuation-from-space-ends-with-on-target-splashdown/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is once again being accused of failing to do enough to prevent ChatGPT from encouraging suicides, even after a series of safety updates were made to a controversial model, 4o, which OpenAI designed to feel like a user's closest confidant.</p>
<p>It's now been revealed that one of the most shocking ChatGPT-linked suicides happened shortly after Sam Altman claimed on X that ChatGPT 4o was safe. OpenAI had "been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues" associated with ChatGPT use, Altman claimed in October, hoping to alleviate concerns after ChatGPT <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">became a "suicide coach"</a> for a vulnerable teenager named Adam Raine, the family's lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Altman's post came on October 14. About two weeks later, 40-year-old Austin Gordon, died by suicide between October 29 and November 2, according to a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gray-v-OpenAI-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by his mother, Stephanie Gray.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/chatgpt-wrote-goodnight-moon-suicide-lullaby-for-man-who-later-killed-himself/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and 10 other Democratic members of Congress today urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile's broken promises related to Trump phone delivery dates and claims that it is "made in the USA."</p>
<p>The request isn't likely to get very far. Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/trump-declares-sweeping-power-over-independent-agencies-such-as-fcc-and-sec/">declared</a> early in his second term that independent agencies like the FTC may no longer operate independently from the White House, and FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-fires-both-ftc-democrats-in-challenge-to-supreme-court-precedent/">backed Trump's claim</a> of authority over historically independent agencies. The Supreme Court appears <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/supreme-court-appears-likely-to-approve-trumps-firing-of-ftc-democrat/">likely to approve</a> Trump's firing of an FTC Democrat, giving him expanded power over the agency.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/updated_final_letter_to__the_federal_trade_commission_on_trump_mobile_delays.pdf">letter</a>, led by Warren and other lawmakers, was sent to Ferguson. "We write today regarding questions about false advertising and deceptive practices by Trump Mobile, and to seek information on how the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) intends to address any potential violations of consumer protection law given the inherent conflicts of interest presented by the company’s relationship to President Donald Trump," the letter said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/democrats-ask-trumps-ftc-to-investigate-trump-mobiles-broken-promises/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, news about the adoption rates for Apple's iOS 26 update started making the rounds. The new update, these reports <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/ios-26-adoption-struggles-with-iphone-users">claim</a>, was being installed at dramatically lower rates than past iOS updates. And while we can't infer anything about <em>why </em>people might choose not to install iOS 26, the conclusion being jumped to is that iPhone users are simply desperate to avoid the redesigned Liquid Glass user interface.</p>
<p>The numbers do, in fact, look bad: Statcounter data for January <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/mobile-tablet/worldwide/#monthly-202506-202601">suggests</a> that the various versions of iOS 26 are running on just 16.6 percent of all devices, compared to around 70 percent for the various versions of iOS 18. The iOS 18.7 update alone—released at the same time as iOS 26.0 in September for people who wanted the security patches but weren't ready to step up to a brand-new OS—appears to be running on nearly one-third of all iOS devices.</p>
<p>Those original reports were picked up and repeated because they tell a potentially interesting story of the "huge if true" variety: that users' aversion to the Liquid Glass design is so intense and widespread that it's actively keeping users away from the operating system. But after examining our own traffic numbers, as well as some technical changes made in iOS 26, it appears Statcounter's data is dramatically undercounting the number of iOS 26 devices in the wild.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/are-people-avoiding-ios-26-because-of-liquid-glass-its-complicated/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Pairing Bluetooth devices can be a pain, but Google Fast Pair makes it almost seamless. Unfortunately, it may also leave your headphones vulnerable to remote hacking. A team of security researchers from Belgium’s KU Leuven University has revealed a vulnerability dubbed WhisperPair that allows an attacker to hijack Fast Pair-enabled devices to spy on the owner.</p>
<p>Fast Pair is widely used, and your device may be vulnerable even if you've never used a Google product. The bug affects more than a dozen devices from 10 manufacturers, including Sony, Nothing, JBL, OnePlus, and Google itself. Google has acknowledged the flaw and notified its partners of the danger, but it's up to these individual companies to create patches for their accessories. A full list of vulnerable devices is available on the <a href="https://whisperpair.eu/">project's website</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers say that it takes only a moment to gain control of a vulnerable Fast Pair device (a median of just 10 seconds) at ranges up to 14 meters. That's near the limit of the Bluetooth protocol and far enough that the target wouldn't notice anyone skulking around while they hack headphones.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/researchers-reveal-whisperpair-attack-to-eavesdrop-on-google-fast-pair-headphones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A PC mod that added online gameplay to Rockstar's 2006 school-exploration title <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/10/bully/"><em>Bully</em></a> was abruptly taken down on Wednesday, roughly a month after it was first made available. While the specific reason for the "Bully Online" takedown hasn't been publicly discussed, a <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964">message posted by the developers</a> to the project's now-defunct Discord server clarifies that "this was not something we wanted."</p>
<p>The Bully Online mod was spearheaded by Swegta, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SWEGTA/videos">Rockstar-focused YouTuber</a> who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-may-not-have-bully-2-but-this-fan-made-bully-online-mod-may-be-the-next-best-thing">formally announced the project in October</a> as a mod that "allows you and your friends to play minigames, role-play, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more."</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Swegta said the mod was "a project me and my team have been working on for a very long time" and that early access in December would be limited to those who contributed at least $8 to a Ko-Fi account. When December actually rolled around, though, a message on Swegta.com (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260113025609/https://swegta.com/">archived</a>) suggested that the mod was being released freely as an open source project, with a registration page (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260114160805/https://swegta.com/online/">archived</a>) offering new accounts to anyone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/online-mod-for-rockstars-classic-bully-is-abruptly-taken-down-after-one-month/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the Wikimedia Foundation <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2026/01/15/wikipedia-celebrates-25years/">announced</a> licensing deals with Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Perplexity, and Mistral AI, expanding its effort to charge major tech companies for using Wikipedia content to train the AI models that power AI assistants like Microsoft Copilot and OpenAI's ChatGPT.</p>
<p>While these same companies <a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/research/library/generative-ai-training-data/common-crawl/">previously scraped</a> Wikipedia without permission, the deals mean that most major AI developers have now signed on to the foundation's Wikimedia Enterprise program, a commercial subsidiary that sells API access to Wikipedia's 65 million articles at higher speeds and volumes than the free public APIs provide. The foundation did not disclose the financial terms of the deals.</p>
<p>The new partners join Google, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/22/23178245/google-paying-wikimedia-foundation-information">signed</a> a deal with Wikimedia Enterprise in 2022, as well as smaller companies like Ecosia, Nomic, Pleias, ProRata, and Reef Media. The revenue helps offset infrastructure costs for the nonprofit, which otherwise relies on small public donations while watching its content become a staple of training data for AI models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/wikipedia-will-share-content-with-ai-firms-in-new-licensing-deals/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump has announced new tariffs on Nvidia and AMD as part of a novel scheme to enact a deal with the technology giants to take a 25 percent cut of sales of their AI processors to China.</p>
<p>In December, the White House said it would allow Nvidia to start shipping its H200 chips to China, reversing a policy that prohibited the export of advanced AI hardware. However, it demanded a 25 percent cut of the sales.</p>
<p>The new US tariffs on certain chips, announced on Wednesday, were designed to implement these payments and protect the unusual arrangement from legal challenges, according to several industry executives.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/us-government-to-take-25-cut-of-amd-nvidia-ai-sales-to-china/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On the first day of this year’s Mille Miglia, a voice rose from the crowds gathered on the shore of Lago di Garda to shout “no sound, no feeling!”at my Polestar 3. Italians love their cars, and they revealed a clear preference for internal combustion engines over the next four days and over 1,200 km of driving. But plenty of other spectators smiled and waved, and some even did a double-take at seeing an electric vehicle amid the sea of modern Ferraris and world-class vintage racers taking on this modern regulation rally.</p>
<p>I flew to Italy to join the Mille Miglia “Green,” which<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">, for the past five years, has sought to raise awareness of sustainability and electric cars amid this</span><a href="https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/june-1955/14/moss-mille-miglia/"> famous (some might say infamous) race</a>. And despite mixed reactions from the Italian crowds, our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-polestar-3-drives-sporty-looks-sharp-can-be-a-little-annoying/">Polestar 3</a> performed quite well as it traced a historical route from Brescia to Rome and back.</p>
<p>The route snaked a trail through the Italian countryside based on the original speed race’s first 12 outings, but instead of going for overall pace, we spent five days competing against six other EVs for points based on time, distance, and average speed. Our team included a Polestar 2 and 4, and we faced a Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology, an Abarth 600e, a Lotus Eletre, and a BYD Denza Z9GT saloon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/01/the-difficulty-of-driving-an-ev-in-the-most-beautiful-race-in-the-world/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Next week, Volvo shows off its new EX60 SUV to the world. It's the brand's next electric vehicle, one built on an all-new, EV-only platform that makes use of the latest in vehicle design trends, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/volvo-says-new-ex60-has-400-mile-range-charges-up-to-400-kw/">a cell-to-body battery pack</a>, large weight-saving castings, and an advanced electronic architecture run by a handful of computers capable of more than 250 trillion operations per second. This new software-defined platform even has a name: HuginCore, after one of the two ravens that collected information for the Norse god Odin.</p>
<p>It's not Volvo's first reference to mythology. "We have Thor's Hammer [Volvo's distinctive headlight design] and now we have HuginCore... one of the two trusted Ravens of Oden. He sent Hugin and Muninn out to fly across the realms and observe and gather information and knowledge, which they then share with Odin that enabled him to make the right decisions as the ruler of Asgard," said Alwin Bakkenes, head of global software engineering at Volvo Cars.</p>
<p>"And much like Hugin, the way we look at this technology platform, it collects information from all of the sensors, all of the actuators in the vehicle. It understands the world around the vehicle, and it enables us to actually anticipate around what lies ahead," Bakkenes told me.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/exclusive-volvo-tells-us-why-having-gemini-in-your-next-car-is-a-good-thing/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>History buffs are no doubt familiar with the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrack_Byfield">Shadrack Byfield</a>, a rank-and-file British redcoat who fought during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812">War of 1812</a> and lost his left arm to a musket ball for his trouble. Byfield has been featured in numerous popular histories—including a children's book and a 2011 PBS documentary—as a shining example of a disabled soldier's stoic perseverance. But a newly rediscovered memoir that Byfield published in his later years is complicating that idealized picture of his post-military life, according to a new paper published in the Journal of British Studies.</p>
<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Historian <a href="https://www.mun.ca/history/people/post-doc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eamonn O'Keeffe</a> of Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, Canada, has been a Byfield fan ever since he read the 1985 children's novel, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7906601-redcoat"><em>Redcoat</em></a>, by Gregory Sass. His interest grew when he was working at Fort York, a War of 1812-era fort and museum, in Toronto. "There are dozens of memoirs written by British rank-and-file veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, but only a handful from the War of 1812, which was much smaller in scale," O'Keeffe told Ars. "Byfield's autobiography seemed to offer an authentic, ground-level view of the fighting in North America, helping us look beyond the generals and politicians and grapple with the implications of this conflict for ordinary people.</span></p>
<p>Born in 1789 in Wiltshire's Bradford-on-Avon suburbs, Byfield's parents intended him to follow in his weaver father's footsteps. He enlisted in the county militia when he turned 18 instead, joining the regular army the following year. When the War of 1812 broke out, Byfield was stationed at Fort George along the Niagara River, participating in the successful siege of Fort Detroit. At the Battle of Frenchtown in January 1813, he was shot in the neck, but he recovered sufficiently to join the campaigns against Fort Meigs and Fort Stephenson in Ohio.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/a-british-redcoats-lost-memoir-resurfaces/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth touted their desire to “make <i>Star Trek</i> real”—while unconsciously reminding us of what the utopian science fiction franchise is fundamentally about.</p>
<p>Their Tuesday event was the latest in Hegseth’s ongoing “Arsenal of Freedom” tour, which was held at SpaceX headquarters in Starbase, Texas. (Itself a newly created town that takes its name from a term popularized by <i>Star Trek</i>.)</p>
<p>Neither Musk nor Hegseth seemed to recall that the “Arsenal of Freedom” phrase—at least in the context of <i>Star Trek</i>—is also the title of a 1988 episode of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation. </i>That episode depicts an AI-powered weapons system, and its automated salesman, which destroys an entire civilization and eventually threatens the crew of the USS <em>Enterprise</em>. (Some <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adam.holisky.com/post/3mcdvfudnks2c">Trekkies</a> made the connection, however.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/pentagons-arsenal-of-freedom-tour-borrows-name-from-star-trek-episode-about-killer-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October is now wildly accelerating, doubling in just the past week to a total of <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak">434 cases</a>, with 409 people currently in quarantine.</p>
<p>Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-124-new-measles-cases-upstate-new-public-exposures-and">124 more cases</a> since last Friday, which had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/measles-continues-raging-in-south-carolina-99-new-cases-since-tuesday/">99 new cases</a> since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-26-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-211">211 cases</a>.</p>
<p>With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/sc-measles-outbreak-has-gone-berserk-124-cases-since-friday-409-quarantined/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has fixed a vulnerability in its Copilot AI assistant that allowed hackers to pluck a host of sensitive user data with a single click on a legitimate URL.</p>
<p>The hackers in this case were white-hat researchers from <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/reprompt">security firm Varonis</a>. The net effect of their multistage attack was that they exfiltrated data, including the target’s name, location, and details of specific events from the user’s Copilot chat history. The attack continued to run even when the user closed the Copilot chat, with no further interaction needed once the user clicked the link, a legitimate Copilot one, in the email. The attack and resulting data theft bypassed enterprise endpoint security controls and detection by endpoint protection apps.</p>
<h2>It just works</h2>
<p>“Once we deliver this link with this malicious prompt, the user just has to click on the link and the malicious task is immediately executed,” Varonis security researcher Dolev Taler told Ars. “Even if the user just clicks on the link and immediately closes the tab of Copilot chat, the exploit still works.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/a-single-click-mounted-a-covert-multistage-attack-against-copilot/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Since the days of <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> and <em>Doom</em>, the humble first-person shooter has flourished in myriad and complex directions. The genre has expanded in narrative and gameplay terms to include everything from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/i-played-half-life-2-for-the-first-time-this-year-heres-how-it-went/">sprawling sci-fi</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/review-halo-infinites-campaign-finishes-the-fight-but-arrives-in-tatters/">epics</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/08/bioshock-objectivism-philosophy-analysis/">dense objectivist allegories</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-review-war-games-now-with-battle-royale/">multiplayer-focused military free-for-alls</a> and practically everything in between.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you just want an excuse to shoot a bunch of weird little guys in weird little spaces.</p>

<p>For those times, there is <em>Oddcore</em>, a new Early Access, roguelike boomer shooter that is a stark contrast to the more sprawling self-serious shooters out there. The game's combination of frenetic, quick-moving action, semi-randomized scenarios, and well-balanced risk/reward upgrade system makes for a pick-up-and-play shooter that I find myself struggling not to pick up and play for a few more quick-hit sessions even as I write this.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/i-cant-stop-shooting-oddcores-endless-waves-of-weird-little-guys/">Read full article</a></p>
