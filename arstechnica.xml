<p>The hot water took too long to come out of the tap. That is what I was trying to solve. I did not intend to discover that, for a while there, water heaters like mine may have been open to anybody. That, with some API tinkering and an email address, a bad actor could possibly set its temperature or make it run constantly. That’s just how it happened.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back. My wife and I moved into a new home last year. It had a Rinnai <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters">tankless water heater</a> tucked into a utility closet in the garage. The builder and home inspector didn't say much about it, just to run a yearly cleaning cycle on it.</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t keep a big tank of water heated and ready to be delivered to any house tap, tankless water heaters save energy—up to 34 percent, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters">according to the Department of Energy</a>. But they're also, by default, slower. Opening a tap triggers the exchanger, heats up the water (with natural gas, in my case), and the device has to push it through the line to where it's needed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020163#p3">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020163&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.44 of the Rocket Report! Kathy Lueders, general manager of SpaceX's Starbase launch facility, says the company expects to receive an FAA launch license for the next Starship test flight shortly after Memorial Day. It looks like this rocket could fly in late May or early June, about two-and-a-half months after the previous Starship test flight. This is an improvement over the previous intervals of seven months and four months between Starship flights.</p>

<p>An Arizona woman has been accused of helping generate millions of dollars for North Korea’s ballistic missile program by helping citizens of that country land IT jobs at US-based Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Christina Marie Chapman, 49, of Litchfield Park, Arizona, raised $6.8 million in the scheme, federal prosecutors said in an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1352191/dl">indictment</a> unsealed Thursday. Chapman allegedly funneled the money to North Korea’s Munitions Industry Department, which is involved in key aspects of North Korea’s weapons program, including its development of ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>Part of the alleged scheme involved Chapman and co-conspirators compromising the identities of more than 60 people living in the US and using their personal information to get North Koreans IT jobs across more than 300 US companies.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025081#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025081&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An autopsy report of a Massachusetts teen who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/teens-death-after-eating-a-single-chip-highlights-risks-of-ultra-spicy-foods/">tragically died hours after eating an ultra-spicy tortilla chip</a> suggested that his death was due to the high dose of spice in the chip and a congenital heart defect, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/paqui-spicy-chip-challenge-death-autopsy-f81c220c549ec497bcc626dec4fc2be4">according to an autopsy report obtained by the Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>Harris Wolobah, a previously healthy 14-year-old from Worcester, died September 1, 2023 hours after eating the chip—a 2023 Paqui One Chip Challenge chip—which were sold individually, wrapped in tin foil, and seasoned with two of hottest peppers in the world, the Naga Viper pepper and the Carolina Reaper pepper. Paqui sold the chip with a challenge in which eaters were dared to consume the chip, wait as long as possible before eating or drinking anything, and post the aftermath on social media, where the challenge went viral.</p>
<p>Harris' mother, Lois Wolobah, immediately suspected the chip was involved in his untimely death. At the time, she reportedly said she picked him up from school after getting a call from the nurse. He was clutching his stomach and, about two hours later, lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital, where he died. She reported that he had no known medical conditions at the time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025060#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025060&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a lawsuit that seems determined to ignore that Section 230 exists, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has sued Meta for allegedly shadowbanning his million-dollar documentary, <em>Who Is Bobby Kennedy?</em> and preventing his supporters from advocating for his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>According to Kennedy, Meta is colluding with the Biden administration to sway the 2024 presidential election by suppressing Kennedy's documentary and making it harder to support Kennedy's candidacy. This allegedly has caused "substantial donation losses," while also violating the free speech rights of Kennedy, his supporters, and his film's production company, AV24.</p>
<p>Meta had initially restricted the documentary on Facebook and Instagram but later fixed the issue after discovering that the film was mistakenly flagged by the platforms' automated spam filters.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025044#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025044&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>This week the European Space Agency posted a slightly ominous note regarding its BepiColombo spacecraft, which consists of two orbiters bound for Mercury.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/Glitch_on_BepiColombo_work_ongoing_to_restore_spacecraft_to_full_thrust">online news release</a> cited a "glitch" with the spacecraft that is impairing its ability to generate thrust. The problem was first noted on April 26, when the spacecraft's primary propulsion system was scheduled to undertake an orbital maneuver. Not enough electrical power was delivered to the solar-electric propulsion system at the time.</p>
<p>According to the space agency, a team involving its own engineers and those of its industrial partners began working on the issue. By May 7 they had made some progress, restoring the spacecraft's thrust to about 90 percent of its original level. But this is not full thrust, and the root cause of the problem is still poorly understood.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025024#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025024&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The North Carolina State Senate on Wednesday voted 30–15, along party lines, in favor of a Republican bill that would make it illegal for people in the state to wear a mask in public for health reasons. The bill is now moving to the House, where it could potentially see changes.</p>
<p>The proposed ban on health-based masking is part of a larger bill otherwise aimed at increasing penalties for people wearing masks to conceal their identity while committing a crime or impeding traffic. The bill was largely spurred by recent protests on university and college campuses across the country, including North Carolina-based schools, against the war in Gaza. In recent months, there have been demonstrations in Raleigh and Durham that have blocked roadways, as well as clashes on the nearby campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Some demonstrators were seen wearing masks in those events.</p>
<p>But the bill, <a href="https://webservices.ncleg.gov/ViewDocSiteFile/87479">House Bill 237</a>, goes a step further by making it illegal to wear a mask in public for health and safety reasons, either to protect the wearer, those around them, or both. Specifically, the bill repeals a <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/SessionLaws/PDF/2019-2020/SL2020-3.pdf">2020 legal exemption</a> enacted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed for public health-based masking for the first time in decades.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025011#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025011&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google I/O has come and gone, and with it came an almost exclusive focus on AI. Part of the show was an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">announcement for Google Search</a> that was so huge it was almost hard to believe: the AI-powered "Search Generative Experience (SGE)" that the company had been trialing for months is rolling out to <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/"><em>everyone </em>in the US</a>. The feature, renamed "AI Overview," is here now, and it feels like the biggest change to Google Search ever. The top of many results (especially questions) are now dominated by an AI box that scrapes the web and gives you a sometimes-correct summary without needing to click on a single result.</p>
<p>AI Overview is a bit different from the SGE trials that were happening. First is that AI Overview is a lot faster than SGE. For some popular queries, it seems like Google is caching the AI answer, which should help with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/chatgpt-style-search-represents-a-10x-cost-increase-for-google-microsoft/">the high cost</a> of running generative AI. For queries with cached overviews, you'll see the AI box load <em>instantly, </em>right along with the initial search results pop-in. SGE responses would come in word by word, like they are being typed by a person. When you aren't getting a cached result, you'll see a blank AI overview box that loads with the search page, which will say "searching" while it loads for a second or two. Other times, Google will try loading an AI Overview and fail, with the message "An AI overview is not available for this search." (As if anyone asked.)</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2.jpg"><img alt='Left: The default results show no webpages at all on the first screen. Right: The "Web" filter looks like Old Google.' src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2-980x579.jpg"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Left: The default results show no webpages at all on the first screen. Right: The "Web" filter looks like Old Google.</a> (credit: Ron Amadeo / Google)</p></div>
<p>When Google decides you have an AI-appropriate query, it now takes a lot of scrolling to see web results. Google scrolls infinitely, so there are no "pages" anymore, but let's consider a "page" to be a full browser viewport height: The first page is an AI overview that takes up half the screen and then another answer box extracted from some website. Page two is a "People also ask" box suggesting other queries, then <em>one</em> search result, then a box for videos. Page three is the bottom half of the video box, then a "Discussions and forums" section with Reddit and Quora posts. It's not until page four and miles of scrolling that we get the traditional 10 blue links. This list isn't even counting an ad block, which would appear first normally. I've yet to see an ad block and AI overview at the same time, but I'm sure that's coming. Despite pushing AI Overviews live into production for everyone on the most premium spot on the Google Search page, Google still notes that "Generative AI is experimental."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024844#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024844&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm not a fat-tire bike guy. My tire tastes run toward the thinner end of the spectrum: 28s on my road bike and 35s on my gravel bike. And I must confess to some distaste for fat-tire e-bikes, which I mostly encounter being ridden (and occasionally even pedaled) on local bike trails. But the $3,995 <a href="https://pedegoelectricbikes.com/product/moto-the-dual-sport-ebike/?color=matte-black&amp;battery=48V+19.2Ah">Pedego Moto</a> caught my eye. The specs were impressive, but more importantly, it looked like it would be a blast to ride.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the other e-bikes I've reviewed, the Pedego Moto requires little assembly. The Moto arrived in a massive box strapped to a pallet, but once the box was cut away and the bike exposed, all I had to do was adjust the handlebars with a hex key and the Moto was good to go.</p>
<p>From the headlight to the bench seat, Moto sports a rugged moped vibe. There's a bright color display attached to the handlebars with four control buttons. The two on the front tweak the assist level and navigate setup screens, while the ones on the top and bottom handle power and confirm setup options. There's another controller just below and to the left of the display that handles the turn signals and headlights.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024959#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024959&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A federal judge ruled yesterday that Tesla must face a lawsuit alleging that it committed fraud by misrepresenting the self-driving capabilities of its vehicles.</p>
<p>California resident Thomas LoSavio's lawsuit points to claims made by Tesla and CEO Elon Musk starting in October 2016, a few months before LoSavio bought a 2017 Tesla Model S with "Enhanced Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving Capability." US District Judge Rita Lin in the Northern District of California dismissed some of LoSavio's claims but <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.400427/gov.uscourts.cand.400427.96.0_1.pdf">ruled</a> that the lawsuit can move forward on allegations of fraud:</p>
<blockquote><p>The remaining claims, which arise out of Tesla's alleged fraud and related negligence, may go forward to the extent they are based on two alleged representations: (1) representations that Tesla vehicles have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability and, (2) representations that a Tesla car would be able to drive itself cross-country in the coming year. While the Rule 9(b) pleading requirements are less stringent here, where Tesla allegedly engaged in a systematic pattern of fraud over a long period of time, LoSavio alleges, plausibly and with sufficient detail, that he relied on these representations before buying his car.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tesla previously won a significant ruling in the case when a different <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/judge-upholds-tesla-arbitration-agreement-that-drivers-called-unconscionable/">judge upheld the carmaker's arbitration agreement</a> and ruled that four plaintiffs would have to go to arbitration. But LoSavio had opted out of the arbitration agreement and was given the option of filing an amended complaint.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024945#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024945&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's amazing, and a little sad, to think that something created in 1989 that changed how people used and viewed the then-nascent Internet had nearly vanished by 2024.</p>
<p>Nearly, that is, because the dogged researchers and enthusiasts at The Serial Port channel on YouTube have found what is likely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d149l7SLLXA&amp;t=668s">the last existing copy of Archie.</a> Archie, first crafted by Alan Emtage while a student at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, allowed for the searching of various "anonymous" FTP servers around what was then a very small web of universities, researchers, and government and military nodes. It was groundbreaking; it was the first echo of the "anything, anywhere" Internet to come. And when The Serial Port went looking, it very much did not exist.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CUwR9xdEuZI?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">The Serial Port's journey from wondering where the last Archie server was to hosting its own. </p></div>
<p>While Archie would eventually be supplanted by Gopher, web portals, and search engines, it remains a useful way to index FTP sites and certainly should be preserved. The Serial Port did this, and the road to get there is remarkable and intriguing. You are best off watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUwR9xdEuZI">the video of their rescue</a>, along with its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d149l7SLLXA">explanatory preamble</a>. But I present here some notable bits of the tale, perhaps to tempt you into digging further.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024876#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024876&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>University of Rochester linguist Andrew Bray started out studying the evolution of the trademark sports jargon used in hockey for his master's thesis. For instance, a hockey arena is a "barn," while the puck is a "biscuit." When he would tell people about the project, however, they kept asking if he was trying to determine why American hockey players sound like "fake Canadians." Intrigued, Bray decided to shift his research focus to find out if hockey players did indeed have distinctively Canadian speech patterns and, if so, why this might be the case.</p>
<p>He discovered that US hockey players borrow certain aspects of the Canadian English accent, particularly when it comes to hockey jargon. But they don't follow the typical rules of pronunciation. In short, "American hockey players are not trying to shift their speech to sound more Canadian," Bray said during a press briefing. "They're trying to sound more like a hockey player. That's why it's most evident in hockey-specific terms."</p>
<p>It's a concept known as a "linguistic persona," a means of communicating how one identifies—in this case, as a hockey player— through speech. Bray gave a talk about his research today at <a href="https://acousticalsociety.org/ottawa/">a meeting</a> of the Acoustical Society of America in Ottawa, Canada, held in conjunction with the Canadian Acoustical Association.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024729#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024729&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the past decade, the dating app Bumble has claimed to be all about empowering women. But under a new CEO, Lidiane Jones, Bumble is now apologizing for a tone-deaf ad campaign that many users said seemed to channel <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/incels-involuntary-celibates">incel ideology</a> by telling women to stop denying sex.</p>
<p>"You know full well a vow of celibacy is not the answer,” one Bumble billboard seen in Los Angeles read. "Thou shalt not give up on dating and become a nun," read another.</p>

<p>Intel this week announced new Thunderbolt software made for connecting two PCs. Thunderbolt Share will require Intel-licensed hardware and is looking to make it simpler to do things like transferring large files from one PC to another or working with two systems simultaneously.</p>
<p>For example, you could use a Thunderbolt cable to connect one laptop to another and then configure the system so that your keyboard, mouse, and monitor work with both computers. Thunderbolt Share also enables dragging and dropping and syncing files between computers.</p>
<p>The app has similar functionality to a KVM switch or apps like PCmover, Logitech Flow, or <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2334829/intel-thunderbolt-share-app-mac-sharing-mode.html">macOS' File Sharing and Screen Sharing</a>, which enable wireless file sharing. But Thunderbolt Share comes with Intel-backed Thunderbolt 4 or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/intel-confirms-thunderbolt-5-name-120gbps-tech-arrives-in-2024/">Thunderbolt 5</a> speeds (depending on the hardware) and some critical requirements.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024849#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024849&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Years ago, Sony started making <a href="https://playstation.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_for_PlayStation_4">a select handful of "PlayStation 2 Classics"</a> available as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/the-ps4-can-now-emulate-playstation-2-games/">emulated downloads on the PlayStation 4</a>. Now, there are signs that certain PS2 games will be similarly available for native download on the PS5, complete with new features like "up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters."</p>
<p>The hint at Sony's coming PS2 download plans comes via a new PlayStation Network listing for the 2002 release <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>, which recently appeared <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars">on tracking site PSDeals</a> (as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store">noticed by Gematsu</a>). That site draws from unpublished data from the PSN servers, such as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/store/api/chihiro/00_09_000/container/US/en/99/UP1082-CUSA48010_00-0677672120279659/0/image?_version=00_09_000&amp;platform=chihiro&amp;bg_color=000000&amp;opacity=100&amp;w=336&amp;h=336">this thumbnail image that recently appeared on the playstation.com servers,</a> and lists a planned June 11 release for the emulated <em>Clone Wars</em> port.</p>
<p>So far, this is nothing out of the ordinary. But near the bottom of the boilerplate, the listing notes that "this title has been converted from the PlayStation 2 version to the PlayStation 4 <em>and PlayStation 5</em> consoles and <em>provides newly added features</em> [emphasis added]." That's a marked difference from <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA03507_00-SLUS212690000001">earlier "PS2 on PS4" downloadable releases</a>, which only say that they were "converted from the original PlayStation 2 version to the PS4 system."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024887#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024887&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In 1989, a city in Utah upgraded its drinking water system, putting in a whole new system and repurposing the old one to supply cheap untreated water for irrigating lawns and putting out fires. That meant that the treated water suitable for drinking flowed from new spigots, while untreated water gushed from the old ones. Decades went by with no apparent confusion; residents seemed clear on the two different water sources. But, according to an investigation report published recently by state and county health officials, that local knowledge got diluted as new residents moved into the area. And last summer, the confusion over the conduits led to an outbreak of life-threatening illnesses among children.</p>
<p>In July and August of 2023, state and local health officials identified 13 children infected with Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC) O157:H7. The children ranged in age from 1 to 15, with a median age of 4. Children are generally at high risk of severe infections with this pathogen, along with older people and those with compromised immune systems. Of the 13 infected children, seven were hospitalized and two developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a life-threatening complication that can lead to kidney failure.</p>
<p>Preliminary genetic analyses of STEC O157:H7 from two of the children suggested that the children's infections were linked to a common source. So, health officials quickly developed a questionnaire to narrow down the potential source. It soon became clear that the irrigation water—aka untreated, pressurized, municipal irrigation water (UPMIW)—was a commonality among the children. Twelve of 13 infected children reported exposure to it in some form: Two said they drank it; five played with UPMIW hoses; three used the water for inflatable water toys; two used it for a water table; and one ran through sprinklers. None reported eating fruits or vegetables from home (noncommercial) gardens irrigated with the UPMIW.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024860#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024860&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brussels has opened an in-depth probe into Meta over concerns it is failing to do enough to protect children from becoming addicted to social media platforms such as Instagram.</p>
<p>The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, announced on Thursday it would look into whether the Silicon Valley giant’s apps were reinforcing “rabbit hole” effects, where users get drawn ever deeper into online feeds and topics.</p>
<p>EU investigators will also look into whether Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is complying with legal obligations to provide appropriate age-verification tools to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024851#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024851&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Good morning. It's May 16, and today's image comes from an on-demand satellite imagery company <a href="https://www.heospace.com/">named HEO</a>. Only this image is not of the Earth, but rather the International Space Station.</p>
<p>According to the company, which is headquartered in Australia, one of its cameras imaged the space station at a distance of 69.06 km away, over the Indian Ocean. HEO flies its sensors as hosted payloads on satellites in Earth orbit. However, HEO's focus is not on Earth; it's on other spacecraft in low-Earth orbit to assess their status and identify anomalous behavior.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024772#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024772&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The FBI and law enforcement partners worldwide have seized BreachForums, a website that openly trafficked malware and data stolen in hacks.</p>
<p>The site has operated for years as an online trading post where criminals could buy and sell all kinds of compromised data, including passwords, customer records, and other often-times sensitive data. Last week, a site user advertised the sale of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/dell-warns-of-incident-that-may-have-leaked-customers-personal-info/">Dell customer data</a> that was obtained from a support portal, forcing the computer maker to issue a vague warning to those affected. Also last week, Europol <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/europol-confirms-web-portal-breach-says-no-operational-data-stolen/">confirmed to Bleeping Computer</a> that some of its data had been exposed in a breach of one of its portals. The data was put up for sale on BreachForums, Bleeping Computer reported.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the normal BreachForums front page was replaced with one that proclaimed: “This website has been taken down by the FBI and DOJ with assistance from international partners.” It went on to say agents are analyzing the backend data and invited those with information about the site to contact them. A graphic shown prominently at the top showed the forum profile images of the site's two administrators, Baphomet and ShinyHunters, positioned behind prison bars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024837#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024837&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday at Google I/O 2024, Google announced <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/">Veo</a>, a new AI video-synthesis model that can create HD videos from text, image, or video prompts, similar to OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">Sora</a>. It can generate 1080p videos lasting over a minute and edit videos from written instructions, but it has not yet been released for broad use.</p>

<p>Veo reportedly includes the ability to edit existing videos using text commands, maintain visual consistency across frames, and generate video sequences lasting up to and beyond 60 seconds from a single prompt or a series of prompts that form a narrative. The company says it can generate detailed scenes and apply cinematic effects such as time-lapses, aerial shots, and various visual styles</p>
<p>Since the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/when-ai-images-were-mind-blowing-early-users-recall-the-first-days-of-dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a> in April 2022, we've seen a parade of new image synthesis and video synthesis models that aim to allow anyone who can type a written description to create a detailed image or video. While neither technology has been fully refined, both AI image and video generators have been steadily growing more capable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024749#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024749&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
