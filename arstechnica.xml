<p>A few weeks ago, something from the heavens came crashing through the roof of Alejandro Otero's home, and NASA is on the case.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, this nearly two-pound object came from the International Space Station. Otero said it tore through the roof and both floors of his two-story house in Naples, Florida.</p>
<p>Otero wasn't home at the time, but his son was there. A Nest home security camera captured the sound of the crash at 2:34 pm local time (19:34 UTC) on March 8. That's an important piece of information because it is a close match for the time—2:29 pm EST (19:29 UTC)—that US Space Command recorded the reentry of a piece of space debris from the space station. At that time, the object was on a path over the Gulf of Mexico, heading toward southwest Florida.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013803#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013803&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly">announced</a> that visitors to the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT website</a> in some regions can now use the AI assistant without signing in. Previously, the company required that users create an account to use it, even with the free version of ChatGPT that is currently powered by the GPT-3.5 AI language model. But as we have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">noted in the past</a>, GPT-3.5 is widely known to provide more inaccurate information compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">GPT-4 Turbo</a>, available in paid versions of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Since its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">launch</a> in November 2022, ChatGPT has transformed over time from a tech demo to a comprehensive AI assistant, and it's always had a free version available. The cost is free because "<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/">you're the product</a>," as the old saying goes. Using ChatGPT helps OpenAI gather data that will help the company train future AI models, although free users and ChatGPT Plus subscription members can both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/chatgpt-users-can-now-opt-out-of-chat-history-and-model-training/">opt out</a> of allowing the data they input into ChatGPT to be used for AI training. (OpenAI says it never trains on inputs from <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/team">ChatGPT Team</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/the-new-spreadsheet-openai-introduces-chatgpt-enterprise-for-businesses/">Enterprise</a> members at all).</p>
<p>Opening ChatGPT to everyone could provide a frictionless on-ramp for people who might use it as a substitute for Google Search or potentially gain new customers by providing an easy way for people to use ChatGPT quickly, then offering an upsell to paid versions of the service.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014076#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014076&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Months after unbundling the apps in the European Union, Microsoft is taking the Office and Teams breakup worldwide. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-separate-teams-office-globally-amid-antitrust-scrutiny-2024-04-01/">reports</a> that Microsoft will begin selling Teams and the other Microsoft 365 apps to new commercial customers as separate products with separate price tags beginning today.</p>
<p>"To ensure clarity for our customers, we are extending the steps we took last year to unbundle Teams from M365 and O365 in the European Economic Area and Switzerland to customers globally," a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars. "Doing so also addresses feedback from the European Commission by providing multinational companies more flexibility when they want to standardize their purchasing across geographies."</p>
<p>The unbundling is a win for other team communication apps like Slack and videoconferencing apps like Zoom, both of which predate Teams but haven't had the benefits of the Office apps' huge established user base.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013950#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013950&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Discord had long been strongly opposed to ads, but starting this week, it's giving video game makers the ability to advertise to its users. The introduction of so-called Sponsored Quests marks a notable change from the startup's previous business model, but, at least for now, it seems much less intrusive than the ads shoved into other social media platforms, especially since Discord users can choose not to engage with them.</p>
<p>Discord first announced Sponsored Quests on March 7, with Peter Sellis, Discord's SVP of product, writing in a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/our-quest-to-support-game-developers">blog post</a> that users would start seeing them in the "coming weeks." Sponsored Quests offer PC gamers in-game rewards for getting friends to watch a stream of them playing through Discord. Discord senior product communications manager Swaleha Carlson confirmed to Ars Technica that Sponsored Quests launch this week.</p>

<p>The goal is for video games to get exposure to more gamers, serving as a form of marketing. On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/discord-to-start-showing-ads-for-gamers-to-boost-revenue-bf5848b9">WSJ</a>) reported that it viewed a slide from a slideshow Discord shows to game developers regarding the ads that reads: "We’ll get you in front of players. And those players will get you into their friend groups."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014027#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014027&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/google-agrees-to-settle-in-chrome-incognito-mode-class-action-lawsuit/">settle a class-action dispute over Chrome's "Incognito" mode</a>, Google has <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Brown-v-Google-Unopposed-Motion-for-Final-Approval-of-Class-Action-Settlement-4-1-2024.pdf">agreed</a> to delete billions of data records reflecting users' private browsing activities.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Ars, users' lawyer, David Boies, described the settlement as "a historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies." Based on Google's insights, users' lawyers valued the settlement between $4.75 billion and $7.8 billion, the Monday <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Brown-v-Google-Unopposed-Motion-for-Final-Approval-of-Class-Action-Settlement-4-1-2024.pdf">court filing</a> said.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, Google agreed to delete class-action members' private browsing data collected in the past, as well as to "maintain a change to Incognito mode that enables Incognito users to block third-party cookies by default." This, plaintiffs' lawyers noted, "ensures additional privacy for Incognito users going forward, while limiting the amount of data Google collects from them" over the next five years. Plaintiffs' lawyers said that this means that "Google will collect less data from users’ private browsing sessions" and "Google will make less money from the data."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014074#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014074&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, a tremendously popular tool for storing data in-memory rather than in a database, recently switched its licensing from <a href="https://redis.com/blog/redis-license-bsd-will-remain-bsd/">an open source BSD license</a> to both a <a href="https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/?ref=thestack.technology">Source Available License</a> and a <a href="https://redis.com/legal/server-side-public-license-sspl/?ref=thestack.technology">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL).</p>
<p>The software project and company supporting it were fairly clear in why they did this. <a href="https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">Redis CEO Rowan Trollope wrote on March 20</a> that while Redis and volunteers sponsored the bulk of the project's code development, "the majority of Redis’ commercial sales are channeled through the largest cloud service providers, who commoditize Redis’ investments and its open source community." Clarifying a bit, "cloud service providers hosting Redis offerings will no longer be permitted to use the source code of Redis free of charge."</p>
<p>Clarifying even further: Amazon Web Services (and lesser cloud giants), you cannot continue reselling Redis as a service as part of your $90 billion business without some kind of licensed contribution back.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014018#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014018&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>RIP Google Podcasts. Google's self-branded podcasting service <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/14151168">shuts down tomorrow</a>, April 2, and existing users have until July to export any subscriptions that are still on the service. Google originally announced the shutdown in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/this-weeks-dead-google-products-google-podcasts-basic-gmail-and-more/">September</a> and has been plastering shutdown notices all over the Google Podcasts site and app for a few days now.</p>
<p>Google Podcasts was Google's third podcasting service, after Google Listen (2009–2012) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/google-play-music-podcasts-are-live-for-some-users/">Google Play Music Podcasts</a> (2016–2020). The shutdown will clear the deck for Google's media consolidation under the YouTube brand with podcasting app No. 4: YouTube Podcasts.</p>
<p>Google Podcasts has always had an awkward life.  Despite an eight-year existence, it has only been a viable podcasting app for maybe half that time. The project grew out of the Google Search team's desire to index podcast content. That started in 2016 when searching for a podcast would <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/listen-to-podcasts-in-google-app-on/">show a player</a> embedded right in the Google Search results. This only worked on google.com and on the Android search app.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014008#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014008&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Heads up, Whovians! We've got a newly regenerated Fifteenth Doctor in Ncuti Gatwa and a new season of the long-running British sci-fi series <em>Doctor Who</em> on the way. Judging by the latest trailer, we're in for another wild ride of time-traveling hijinks, punctuated by an irresistibly charismatic Gatwa sporting some very colorful outfits with confident aplomb.</p>

Among other issues, there was an unfortunate tendency toward didacticism and preachiness in the writing at the expense of genuine emotional resonance. While there were a number of notable episodes, and Chibnall gamely trotted out all the fan-favorite monsters and tropes, nothing ever fully captured the imagination in quite the same way as the show has always done at its best. Whittaker deserved better.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013955#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013955&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been a terrible decade for the Russian launch industry, which once led the world. The country's long-running workhorse, the Proton rocket, ran into reliability issues and will soon be retired. Russia's next-generation rocket, Angara, is fully expendable and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/russias-next-generation-rocket-is-a-decade-old-and-still-flying-dummy-payloads/">still flying dummy payloads</a> on test flights a decade after its debut. And the ever-reliable Soyuz vehicle lost access to lucrative Western markets after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Yet there has been a more fundamental, underlying disease pushing the once-vaunted Russian launch industry toward irrelevance. The country has largely relied on decades-old technology in a time of serious innovation within the launch industry. So what worked at the turn of the century to attract the launches of commercial satellites no longer does against the rising tide of competition from SpaceX, as well as other players in India and China.</p>
<p>Through the first quarter of this year, Russia has launched a total of five rockets, all variants of the Soyuz vehicle. SpaceX alone has launched 32 rockets. China, too, has launched nearly three times as many boosters as Russia.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013957#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013957&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The future of StabilityAI, once seen as among the world’s most promising artificial intelligence start-ups, has been thrown into doubt following the chaotic departure of its founder and concern it will struggle to become profitable.</p>
<p>Emad Mostaque resigned last week as chief executive of the London-based group behind Stable Diffusion, an AI model that can create images through simple written prompts, with its app being downloaded more than 150 million times.</p>
<p>The 3-year-old company was valued at $1 billion in August 2022, following a $101 million funding round led by top US tech investors Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners. The deal put it in the vanguard of the generative AI revolution alongside groups such as OpenAI and Inflection.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013961#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013961&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/what-i-learned-from-using-a-raspberry-pi-5-as-my-main-computer-for-two-weeks/">tried to use a Raspberry Pi 5 as a regular desktop PC</a>. The experiment wasn't a failure—I was able to use a Pi to get most of my work done for a few days. But the device's performance, and especially the relative immaturity of the Linux's Arm software ecosystem, meant that there were lots of incompatibilities and rough edges.</p>
<p>One of the problems with trying to use a Pi 5 as a regular desktop computer is that, by the time you've paid for the 8GB version of the board, a decent active cooler and case, and (ideally) some kind of M.2 storage attachment and SSD, you've spent close to a couple of hundred dollars on the system. That's not a ton of money to spend on a desktop PC, but it <em>is</em> enough that the Pi no longer feels miraculously cheap, and there are actually other, more flexible competitors worth considering.</p>

<p>Consider the selection of sub-$200 mini desktop PCs that litter the online storefronts of Amazon and AliExpress. Though you do need to roll the dice on low-to-no-name brands like Beelink, GMKTec, Firebat, BMax, Trigkey, or Bosgame, it's actually possible to buy a reasonably capable desktop system with 8GB to 16GB of RAM, 256GB or 512GB of storage, a Windows 11 license, and a workaday x86-based Intel CPU for as little as $107, though Amazon pricing usually runs closer to $170.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009827#p3">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009827&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Volvo provided flights from Newark, New Jersey, to Sweden and accommodation so Ars could drive the EX30. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Rear-wheel drive cars long ago earned a reputation for being a bit of a nightmare to live with in snowy, icy conditions. That's partly why Volvo stopped making the things in the 1990s, so it was a surprise that the brand returned to rear-drive for its latest EVs, like its upcoming subcompact SUV, the EX30.</p>
<p>Why the throwback layout? Next-generation stability and traction-control systems, aided by the precise torque delivery of electric motors, allow for advanced modulation of power and braking that would have been impossible on those '90s icons. To see just how well Volvo's engineers succeeded at the task, I headed to northern Sweden to catch the tail of an Arctic winter and see whether this return to RWD was a success.</p>
<h2>The driven wheel dilemma</h2>
<p>Thanks to inertia, having the engine of a car drive the rear wheels actually provides the acceleration. When you accelerate, the car's mass effectively shifts rearward. That additional weight on the rear wheels gives them more grip—and gives you more speed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013765#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013765&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Good morning. It's April 1, and today's photo showcases an airplane—but it's a special airplane with some celestial treats in the background.</p>
<p>The plane is a shortened version of a Boeing 747 that housed the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, known as SOFIA. This airborne observatory first took flight in May 2010 and operated through September 2022. The 2.5-meter telescope flew at about 45,000 feet and observed all manner of phenomena from a vantage point above much of the Earth's atmosphere—celestial magnetic fields, star-forming regions, comets, and more.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013723#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013723&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Friday, a lone Microsoft developer rocked the world when he revealed a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/backdoor-found-in-widely-used-linux-utility-breaks-encrypted-ssh-connections/">backdoor</a> had been intentionally planted in xz Utils, an open source data compression utility available on almost all installations of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The person or people behind this project likely spent years on it. They were likely very close to seeing the backdoor update merged into Debian and Red Hat, the two biggest distributions of Linux, when an eagle-eyed software developer spotted something fishy.</p>
<p>"This might be the best executed supply chain attack we've seen described in the open, and it's a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized upstream in a widely used library," software and cryptography engineer Filippo Valsorda <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3kouaom62oi2b">said</a> of the effort, which came frightfully close to succeeding.</p>
<p>Researchers have spent the weekend gathering clues. Here's what we know so far.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013894#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013894&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brace yourselves, Illinoisans: A truly shocking number of cicadas are about to live, make sweet love, and die in a tree near you. Two broods of periodical cicadas—Brood XIX on a 13-year cycle and Brood XIII on a 17-year cycle—are slated to emerge together in central Illinois this summer for the first time in over two centuries. To most humans, they’re an ephemeral spectacle and an ear-splitting nuisance, and then they’re gone. To many other Midwestern animals, plants, and microbes, they’re a rare feast, bringing new life to forests long past their death.</p>
<p>From Nebraska to New York, 15 broods of periodical cicadas grow underground, quietly sipping watery sap from tree roots. After 13 or 17 years (depending on the brood), countless inch-long adults dig themselves out in sync, crawling out of the ground en masse for a monthlong summer orgy. After mating, they lay eggs in forest trees and die, leaving their tree-born babies to fall to the forest floor and begin the cycle anew. Cicadas don’t fly far from their birthplace, so each brood occupies a distinct patch of the US. “They form a mosaic on the landscape,” says Chris Simon, senior research scientist in ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Most years, at least one of these 15 broods emerges (annual cicadas, not to be confused with their smaller periodical cousins, pop up separately every summer). Sometimes two broods emerge at the same time. It’s also not unheard of for multiple broods to coexist in the same place. “What’s unusual is that these two broods are adjacent,” says John Lill, insect ecologist at George Washington University. “Illinois is going to be ground zero. From the very top to the very bottom of the state, it’s going to be covered in cicadas.” The last time that these broods swarmed aboveground together, Thomas Jefferson was president and the city of Chicago had yet to exist.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013710#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013710&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When we talk about memories in biology, we tend to focus on the brain and the storage of information in neurons. But there are lots of other memories that persist within our cells. Cells remember their developmental history, whether they've been exposed to pathogens, and so on. And that raises a question that has been challenging to answer: How does something as fundamental as a cell hold onto information across multiple divisions?</p>
<p>There's no one answer, and the details are really difficult to work out in many cases. But scientists have now worked out one memory system in detail. Cells are able to remember when their parent had a difficult time dividing—a problem that's often associated with DNA damage and cancer. And, if the problems are substantial enough, the two cells that result from a division will stop dividing themselves.</p>
<h2>Setting a timer</h2>
<p>In multicellular organisms, cell division is very carefully regulated. Uncontrolled division is the hallmark of cancers. But problems with the individual segments of division—things like copying DNA, repairing any damage, making sure each daughter cell gets the right number of chromosomes—can lead to mutations. So, the cell division process includes lots of checkpoints where the cell makes sure everything has worked properly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013795#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013795&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, the IEEE Computer Society announced to members that, after April 1, it would no longer accept papers that include a frequently used image of a 1972 Playboy model named Lena Forsén. The so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#/media/File:Lenna_(test_image).png">Lenna image</a>," (Forsén added an extra "n" to her name in her Playboy appearance to aid pronunciation) has been used in image processing research since 1973 and has <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/it-s-time-to-retire-lena-from-computer-science">attracted criticism</a> for making some women feel unwelcome in the field.</p>

<p>In an email from the IEEE Computer Society sent to members on Wednesday, Technical &amp; Conference Activities Vice President Terry Benzel <a href="https://x.com/MikePFrank/status/1773073214551306369?s=20">wrote</a>, "IEEE's diversity statement and supporting policies such as the IEEE Code of Ethics speak to IEEE's commitment to promoting an including and equitable culture that welcomes all. In alignment with this culture and with respect to the wishes of the subject of the image, Lena Forsén, IEEE will no longer accept submitted papers which include the 'Lena image.'"</p>
<p>An uncropped version of the 512×512-pixel test image originally appeared as the centerfold picture for the December 1972 issue of Playboy Magazine. Usage of the Lenna image in image processing <a href="http://www.lenna.org/pcs_mirror/may_june01.pdf">began in June or July 1973</a> when an assistant professor named Alexander Sawchuck and a graduate student at the University of Southern California Signal and Image Processing Institute scanned a square portion of the centerfold image with a primitive drum scanner, omitting nudity present in the original image. They scanned it for a colleague's conference paper, and after that, others began to use the image as well.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013640#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013640&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you follow generative AI news at all, you're probably familiar with LLM chatbots' tendency to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/thanks-to-ai-hallucinate-is-cambridge-dictionarys-word-of-the-year-for-2023/">"confabulate" incorrect information</a> while presenting that information as authoritatively true. That tendency seems poised to cause some serious problems now that a chatbot run by the New York City government is making up incorrect answers to some important questions of local law and municipal policy.</p>
<p>NYC's "MyCity" ChatBot launched as a "pilot" program <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/777-23/mayor-adams-releases-first-of-its-kind-plan-responsible-artificial-intelligence-use-nyc#/0">last October</a>. The announcement touted the ChatBot as a way for business owners to "save ... time and money by instantly providing them with actionable and trusted information from more than 2,000 NYC Business webpages and articles on topics such as compliance with codes and regulations, available business incentives, and best practices to avoid violations and fines."</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/03/29/ai-chat-false-information-small-business/">a new report</a> from The Markup and local nonprofit news site The City found the MyCity chatbot giving dangerously wrong information about some pretty basic city policies. To cite just one example, the bot said that NYC buildings "are not required to accept Section 8 vouchers," when <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/media/source-of-income.page">an NYC government info page</a> says clearly that <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nycha/section-8/about-section-8.page">Section 8 housing subsidies</a> are one of many lawful sources of income that landlords are required to accept without discrimination. The Markup also received incorrect information in response to chatbot queries regarding worker pay and work hour regulations, as well as industry-specific information like funeral home pricing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013719#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013719&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Researchers have found a malicious backdoor in a compression tool that made its way into widely used Linux distributions, including those from Red Hat and Debian.</p>
<p>The compression utility, known as <a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz">xz Utils</a>, introduced the malicious code in versions ​​5.6.0 and 5.6.1, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">according to</a> Andres Freund, the developer who discovered it. There are no known reports of those versions being incorporated into any production releases for major Linux distributions, but both <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/urgent-security-alert-fedora-41-and-rawhide-users">Red Hat</a> and <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2024/msg00057.html">Debian</a> reported that recently published beta releases used at least one of the backdoored versions—specifically, in Fedora Rawhide and Debian testing, unstable and experimental distributions. A stable release of Arch Linux is also affected. That distribution, however, isn't used in production systems.</p>
<p>Because the backdoor was discovered before the malicious versions of xz Utils were added to production versions of Linux, “it's not really affecting anyone in the real world,” Will Dormann, a senior vulnerability analyst at security firm Analygence, said in an online interview. “BUT that's only because it was discovered early due to bad actor sloppiness. Had it not been discovered, it would have been catastrophic to the world.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013674#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013674&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
