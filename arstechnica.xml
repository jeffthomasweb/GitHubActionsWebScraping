<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Star Wars franchise is creeping up on the 50-year mark for the original 1977 film that started it all, and Disney+ has successfully kept things fresh with its line of live-action Star Wars spinoff series. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/andor-first-impressions-star-wars-inches-toward-the-best-of-modern-adult-tv/"><em>Andor</em></a> were both unquestionably popular and critical successes, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/review-the-book-of-boba-fett-is-lots-of-fun-but-its-really-the-mandalorian-2-5/"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a> ultimately proved disappointing, focusing less on our favorite bounty hunter and more on setting up the third season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi_(miniseries)"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)"><em>Ahsoka</em></a> fell somewhere in between, bolstered by strong performances from its leads but often criticized for sluggish pacing.</p>
<p>It's unclear where the latest addition to the TV franchise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>, will ultimately fall, but the first five episodes aired thus far bode well for its place in the growing canon. The series eschews the usual Star Wars space-battle fare for a quieter, space Western detective story—who is killing the great Jedi masters of the galaxy?—with highly choreographed fight scenes that draw heavily from the martial arts. And like its predecessors, <em>The Acolyte</em> is recognizably Star Wars<em>.</em> Yet it also boasts a unique aesthetic style that is very much its own.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Researchers claim to have developed a new way to run AI language models more efficiently by eliminating matrix multiplication from the process. This fundamentally redesigns neural network operations that are currently accelerated by GPU chips. The findings, detailed in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02528">recent preprint paper</a> from researchers at the University of California Santa Cruz, UC Davis, LuxiTech, and Soochow University, could have deep implications for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/is-generative-ai-really-going-to-wreak-havoc-on-the-power-grid/">environmental impact</a> and operational costs of AI systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication">Matrix multiplication</a> (often abbreviated to "MatMul") is at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/deepmind-breaks-50-year-math-record-using-ai-new-record-falls-a-week-later/">center</a> of most neural network computational tasks today, and GPUs are particularly good at executing the math quickly because they can perform large numbers of multiplication operations in parallel. That ability momentarily made Nvidia the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-ascent-to-most-valuable-company-has-echoes-of-dot-com-boom-dd836c90">most valuable company</a> in the world last week; the company currently holds an estimated <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/">98 percent market share</a> for data center GPUs, which are commonly used to power AI systems like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/google-launches-gemini-a-powerful-ai-model-it-says-can-surpass-gpt-4/">Google Gemini</a>.</p>
<p>In the new paper, titled "Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling," the researchers describe creating a custom 2.7 billion parameter model without using MatMul that features similar performance to conventional large language models (LLMs). They also demonstrate running a 1.3 billion parameter model at 23.8 tokens per second on a GPU that was accelerated by a custom-programmed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> chip that uses about 13 watts of power (not counting the GPU's power draw). The implication is that a more efficient FPGA "paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures," they write.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033314#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033314&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/">MDMA therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder dramatically failed to impress Food and Drug Administration advisers</a> earlier this month, researchers are moving forward with another psychedelic—a slow-release oral dose of the hallucinogenic drug ketamine—as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p>In a mid-stage, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, researchers tested slow-release ketamine pills, taken twice weekly. The trial, sponsored by New Zealand-based Douglas Pharmaceuticals, found ketamine to be safe compared with placebo. At the trial's highest dose, the treatment showed some efficacy against depression in patients who had previously tried an average of nearly five antidepressants without success, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03063-x">according to the results published Monday in Nature Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>But the Phase II trial, which started with 231 participants, indicated that the pool of patients who may benefit from the treatment could be quite limited. The researchers behind the trial chose an unusual "enrichment" design to test the depression treatment. This was intended to thwart the high failure rates generally seen in trials for depression treatments, even in patients without treatment-resistant cases. But even after selecting patients who initially responded to ketamine, 59.5 percent of the enriched participants still dropped out of the trial before its completion, largely due to a lack of efficacy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033492#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033492&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The gryphon, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin">griffin</a>, is a legendary creature dating back to classical antiquity, sporting the body, legs, and tail of a lion and the wings, head, and front talons of an eagle. Since the 1980s, a popular "geomyth" has spread that the griffin's unique appearance was inspired by the fossilized skeleton of a horned dinosaur known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoceratops"><em>Protoceratops</em></a>. It's a fascinating and colorful story, but according to the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03080188241255543">new paper</a> published in the journal Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, there is no hard evidence to support such a connection.</p>
<p>"Everything about griffin origins is consistent with their traditional interpretation as imaginary beasts, just as their appearance is entirely explained by them being [mythological] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)">chimeras</a> of big cats and raptorial birds," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1048872">said co-author Mark Witton</a>, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth. "Invoking a role for dinosaurs in griffin lore, especially species from distant lands like <em>Protoceratops</em>, not only introduces unnecessary complexity and inconsistencies to their origins, but also relies on interpretations and proposals that don’t withstand scrutiny.”</p>
<p>There are representations of griffin-like creatures in ancient Egyptian art dated to before 3000 BCE, while in ancient Greek and Roman texts the creatures were associated with gold deposits in Central Asia. By the Middle Ages, griffins were common figures in medieval iconography and in heraldry. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippogriff">hippogriff</a> named Buckbeak in <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> is a related mythical creature, the product of a griffin and a mare.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032976#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032976&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Almost exactly two years ago, as it prepared for the next generation of human spaceflight, NASA chose a pair of private companies to design and develop new spacesuits. These were to be new spacesuits that would allow astronauts to both perform spacewalks outside the International Space Station as well as walk on the Moon as part of the Artemis program.</p>
<p>Now, that plan appears to be in trouble, with one of the spacesuit providers—Collins Aerospace—expected to back out, Ars has learned. It's a blow for NASA, because the space agency really needs modern spacesuits.</p>
<p>NASA's Apollo-era suits have long been retired. The current suits used for spacewalks in low-Earth orbit are four decades old. "These new capabilities will allow us to continue on the ISS and allows us to do the Artemis program and continue on to Mars," said the director of Johnson Space Center, Vanessa Wyche, during a celebratory news conference in Houston <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/nasa-announces-a-new-plan-to-buy-private-spacesuits-to-make-lunar-landing-date/">two years ago</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033392#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033392&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Verizon Wireless agreed to pay a $1,050,000 penalty to the US Treasury and implement a compliance plan because of a 911 outage in December 2022 that was caused by a botched update, the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-settles-verizon-911-outage-violations-over-1-million">announced</a> today.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-578A1.pdf">consent decree</a> explains that the outage was caused by "the reapplication of a known flawed security policy update file." During the outage, lasting one hour and 44 minutes, Verizon failed to deliver hundreds of 911 calls in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, the FCC said.</p>
<p>"The [FCC] Enforcement Bureau takes any potential violations of the Commission's 911 rules extremely seriously. Sunny day outages, as occurred here, can be especially troubling because they occur when the public and 911 call centers least expect it," Bureau Chief Loyaan Egal said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033451#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033451&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gaming news site PCGamesN has a web tool, <a href="https://www.steamidfinder.com/">SteamIDFinder</a>, that can do a neat trick. If you buy PC games on Steam and have your user profile set to make your gaming details public, you can enter your numeric user ID into it and see a bunch of stats. One set of stats is dedicated to the total value of the games listed as unplayed; you can share this page as an image linking to your "Pile of Shame," which includes the total "Value" of your Steam collection and unplayed games.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img alt="Example findings from SteamIDFinder, from someone who likely has hundreds of games from Humble Bundles and other deals in their library." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Example findings from SteamIDFinder, from someone who likely has hundreds of games from Humble Bundles and other deals in their library. (credit: SteamIDFinder)</p></div>
<p>Using data from what it claims are the roughly 10 percent of 73 million Steam accounts in its database set to Public, PCGamesN extrapolates $1.9 billion in unplayed games, multiplies it by 10, and casually suggests that <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam/pile-of-shame">there are $19 billion in unplayed games hanging around</a>. That is "more than the gross national product of Nicaragua, Niger, Chad, or Mauritius," the site notes.</p>
<h2>That is a very loose “$19 billion”</h2>
<p>"Multiply by 10" is already a pretty soft science, but the numbers are worth digging into further. For starters, SteamIDFinder is using the current sale price of every game in your unplayed library, as confirmed by looking at a half-dozen "Pile of Shame" profiles. An informal poll of Ars Technica co-workers and friends with notable Steam libraries suggests that games purchased at full price make up a tiny fraction of the games in our backlogs. Games acquired through package deals, like the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a>, or during one of Steam's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/steam-summer-sale-best-deals-hidden-gems-indie-games/">annual or one-time sales</a>, are a big part of most people's Steam catalogs, I'd reckon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033313#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033313&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Late last week, both <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-data-centers-power-grids/">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/21/artificial-intelligence-nuclear-fusion-climate/">The Washington Post</a> published stories focused on the ostensibly disastrous impact artificial intelligence is having on the power grid and on efforts to collectively reduce our use of fossil fuels. The high-profile pieces lean heavily on recent projections from <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6b2fd954-2017-408e-bf08-952fdd62118a/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf">the International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) to cast AI's "insatiable" demand for energy as an almost apocalyptic threat to our power infrastructure. The Post piece even cites anonymous "some [people]" in reporting that "some worry whether there will be enough electricity to meet [the power demands] from any source."</p>
<p>Digging into the best available numbers and projections available, though, it's hard to see AI's current and near-future environmental impact in such a dire light. While generative AI models and tools can and will use a significant amount of energy, we shouldn't conflate AI energy usage with the larger and largely pre-existing energy usage of "data centers" as a whole. And just like any technology, whether that AI energy use is worthwhile depends largely on your wider opinion of the value of generative AI in the first place.</p>
<h2>Not all data centers</h2>
<p>While the headline focus of both Bloomberg and The Washington Post's recent pieces is on artificial intelligence, the actual numbers and projections cited in both pieces overwhelmingly focus on the energy used by Internet "data centers" as a whole. Long before generative AI became the current Silicon Valley buzzword, those data centers were already growing immensely in size and energy usage, powering everything from Amazon Web Services servers to online gaming services, Zoom video calls, and cloud storage and retrieval for billions of documents and photos, to name just a few of the more common uses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033273#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033273&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Researchers at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in Australia have developed special “energy-smart bricks” that can be made by mixing clay with glass waste and coal ash. These bricks can help mitigate the negative effects of traditional brick manufacturing, an energy-intensive process that requires large-scale clay mining, contributes heavily to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and generates a lot of air pollution.</p>
<p>According to the RMIT researchers, “Brick kilns worldwide consume 375 million tonnes (~340 million metric tons) of coal in combustion annually, which is equivalent to 675 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emission (~612 million metric tons).” This exceeds the combined annual carbon dioxide emissions of 130 million passenger vehicles in the US.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/these-bricks-are-like-lego-for-full-sized-buildings/">energy-smart bricks</a> rely on a material called RCF waste. It mostly contains fine pieces of glass (92 percent) left over from the recycling process, along with ceramic materials, plastic, paper, and ash. Most of this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/11/global-waste-production-to-triple-by-2100-led-by-sub-saharan-africa/">waste material</a> generally ends up in landfills, where it can cause soil and water degradation. However, the study authors <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950061823037492?via%3Dihub">note</a>, “The utilization of RCF waste in fired-clay bricks offers a potential solution to the increasing global waste crisis and reduces the burden on landfills."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033291#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033291&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During its T85 Titan flyby on July 24, 2012, the Cassini spacecraft registered an unexpectedly bright reflection on the surface of the lake Kivu Lacus. Its Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data was interpreted as a roughness on the methane-ethane lake, which could have been a sign of mudflats, surfacing bubbles, or waves.</p>
<p>“Our landscape evolution models show that the shorelines on Titan are most consistent with Earth lakes that have been eroded by waves,” says Rose Palermo, a coastal geomorphologist at St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center, who led the study investigating signatures of wave erosion on Titan. The evidence of waves is still inconclusive, but future crewed missions to Titan should probably pack some surfboards just in case.</p>
<h2>Troubled seas</h2>
<p>While waves have been considered the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959132/">most plausible explanation</a> for reflections visible in Cassini’s VIMS imagery for quite some time, other studies aimed to confirm their presence found no wave activity at all. “Other observations show that the liquid surfaces have been very still in the past, very flat,” Palermo says. “A possible explanation for this is at the time we were observing Titan, the winds were pretty low, so there weren’t many waves at that time. To confirm waves, we would need to have better resolution data,” she adds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033382#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033382&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft may be hit with a massive fine in the European Union for "possibly abusively" bundling Teams with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites for businesses.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the European Commission (EC) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/es/ip_24_3446">announced</a> preliminary findings of an investigation into whether Microsoft's "suite-centric business model combining multiple types of software in a single offering" unfairly shut out rivals in the "software as a service" (SaaS) market.</p>
<p>"Since at least April 2019," the EC found, Microsoft's practice of "tying Teams with its core SaaS productivity applications" potentially restricted competition in the "market for communication and collaboration products."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033342#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033342&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Artificial intelligence-generated “deepfakes” that impersonate politicians and celebrities are far more prevalent than efforts to use AI to assist cyber attacks, according to the first research by Google’s DeepMind division into the most common malicious uses of the cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13843">The study</a> said the creation of realistic but fake images, video, and audio of people was almost twice as common as the next highest misuse of generative AI tools: the falsifying of information using text-based tools, such as chatbots, to generate misinformation to post online.</p>
<p>The most common goal of actors misusing generative AI was to shape or influence public opinion, the analysis, conducted with the search group’s research and development unit Jigsaw, found. That accounted for 27 percent of uses, feeding into fears over how deepfakes might influence elections globally this year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033304#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033304&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A small spacecraft landed in Inner Mongolia on Tuesday, bringing samples from the far side of the Moon back to Earth.</p>
<p>This was not China's first robotic mission to return a few pounds of dust and pebbles from the lunar surface—that came with the Chang'e 5 mission in December 2020. However, this was the first time any space program in the world returned material from the Moon's far side.</p>
<p>The successful conclusion of this mission, which launched from Earth nearly two months ago, marked another significant achievement for China's space program as the country sets its sights on landing humans on the Moon by the year 2030.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033288#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033288&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Peter Beck has been having a pretty great June. Earlier this month, he was made a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. Then, <em>Sir</em> Peter Beck presided as Rocket Lab launched its 50th Electron rocket, becoming the fastest company to launch its 50th privately developed booster.</p>
<p>Finally, last week, Rocket Lab revealed that it had signed its largest launch contract ever: 10 flights for the Japanese Earth-observation company Synspective. Ars caught up with Beck while he was in Tokyo for the announcement. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation, which touches on a variety of launch-related issues.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica</strong>: <strong>Hi Pete. We've talked about competition in small launch for years. But when I tally up the record of some of your US competitors—Firefly, Astra, Relativity Space, Virgin Orbit, and ABL—they're 7-for-21 on launch attempts. And if you remove the now-retired rockets, it's 1-for-6. Some of these competitors have, or did, exist for a decade. What does this say about the launch business?</strong></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033175#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033175&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>WordPress plugins running on as many as 36,000 websites have been backdoored in a supply-chain attack with unknown origins, security researchers said on Monday.</p>
<p>So far, five plugins are known to be affected in the campaign, which was active as recently as Monday morning, researchers from security firm Wordfence <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2024/06/supply-chain-attack-on-wordpress-org-plugins-leads-to-5-maliciously-compromised-wordpress-plugins/">reported</a>. Over the past week, unknown threat actors have added malicious functions to updates available for the plugins on WordPress.org, the official site for the open source WordPress CMS software. When installed, the updates automatically create an attacker-controlled administrative account that provides full control over the compromised site. The updates also add content designed to goose search results.</p>
<h2>Poisoning the well</h2>
<p>“The injected malicious code is not very sophisticated or heavily obfuscated and contains comments throughout making it easy to follow,” the researchers wrote. “The earliest injection appears to date back to June 21st, 2024, and the threat actor was still actively making updates to plugins as recently as 5 hours ago.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033226#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033226&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has added the ability to format external drives in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, the major software updates for iPhones and iPads due later this year.</p>
<p>While the feature likely won't be tapped by all that many users, its inclusion is fascinating in that it shows just how far Apple has moved away from its original sensibilities with the iPhone and the iPad.</p>
<p>The feature was discovered in the iPadOS 18 beta by artist and developer Kaleb Cadle, who posted about it to his Substack <a href="https://kalebcadle.substack.com/p/ipados-18-adds-another-very-useful">ByteBits</a> a couple of days ago. It was later found in iOS 18 as well.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033190#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033190&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of Windows 11's more contentious changes is that, by default, both the Home and Pro editions of the operating system require users to sign in with a Microsoft account during setup. Signing in with an account does get you some benefits, at least if you're a regular user of other Microsoft products like OneDrive, GamePass, or Microsoft 365 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rip-to-microsoft-office-henceforth-to-be-known-as-microsoft-365/">aka Office</a>). But if you don't use those services, a lot of what a Microsoft account gets you in Windows 11 is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-11-has-made-the-clean-windows-install-an-oxymoron/">repeated ads and reminders</a> about signing up for those services. Using Windows with a traditional local account is still extremely possible, but it does require a small amount of know-how beyond just clicking the right buttons.</p>

<p>On the know-how front, Microsoft has taken one more minor, but nevertheless irritating, step away from allowing users to sign in with local accounts. This <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">official Microsoft support page</a> walks users with local accounts through the process of signing in to a Microsoft account. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240612104753/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">As recently as June 12</a>, that page also included instructions for converting a Microsoft account into a local account. But according to Tom's Hardware and the Internet Wayback Machine, those instructions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240617103839/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">disappeared on or around June 17</a> and haven't been seen since.</p>
<p>Despite the documentation change, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">most of the workarounds</a> for creating a local account still work in both Windows 11 23H2 (the publicly available version of Windows 11 for most PCs) and 24H2 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/">available now on Copilot+ PCs</a>, later this fall for everyone else). The easiest way to do it on a PC you just took out of the box is to press Shift+F10 during the setup process to bring up a command prompt window, typing <code>OOBE\BYPASSNRO</code>, rebooting, and then clicking the "I don't have Internet" button when asked to connect to a Wi-Fi network.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033155#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033155&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Linux and its code are made by people, and people are not with us forever. Over the weekend, a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ds6wc3svkyre4p2rwg4f76o67xndazaeoyjwblhuzichscyxoz@5ttdvbymxr55/T/#mfd2f4928e0e013c10375ca766035c1385e18f8e0">brief message on the Linux kernel mailing list</a> reminded everyone of just how much one person can mean to a seemingly gargantuan project like Linux, and how quickly that person can disappear.</p>
<p>Denise Finger, wife of the deceased, wrote to the Linux Wireless list on Friday evening:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is to notify you that Larry Finger, one of your developers, passed away on June 21st.</p></blockquote>
<p>LWN.net reckons that <a href="https://hkfuneralhome.com/larry-finger/">Finger, 84</a>, contributed to 94 Linux kernel releases, or 1,464 commits total, at least since <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_16">kernel 2.6.16 in 2006</a> (and when the kernel started using git to track changes). Given the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/linus-torvalds-reiterates-his-tabs-versus-spaces-stance-with-a-kernel-trap/">sometimes precarious nature of contributing to the kernel</a>, this is on its own an impressive achievement—especially for someone with no formal computer training and who considered himself a scientist.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033066#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033066&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
