            <![CDATA[Instead of sensing photons and processing the results, why not process the photons?]]>
          </description>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A standard digital camera used in a car for stuff like emergency braking has a perceptual latency of a hair above 20 milliseconds. That’s just the time needed for a camera to transform the photons hitting its aperture into electrical chargers using either CMOS or CCD sensors. It doesn’t count the further milliseconds needed to send that information to an onboard computer or process it there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A team of MIT researchers figured that if you had a chip that could process photons directly, you could skip the entire digitization step and perform calculations with the photons themselves. It has the potential to be mind-bogglingly faster.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re focused on a very specific metric here, which is latency. We aim for applications where what matters the most is how fast you can produce a solution. That’s why we are interested in systems where we’re able to do all the computations optically,” says Saumil Bandyopadhyay, an MIT researcher, The team that implemented a complete deep neural network on a photonic chip, achieving a latency of 410 picoseconds. To put that in perspective, Bandyopadhyay’s chip could process the entire neural net it had onboard around 58 times within a single tick of the 4 GHz clock on a standard CPU.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/getting-an-all-optical-ai-to-handle-non-linear-math/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><strong>COCOA BEACH, Fla.</strong>—As it so often does in the final days before the debut of a new rocket, it all comes down to weather. Accordingly, Blue Origin is only awaiting clear skies and fair seas for its massive New Glenn vehicle to lift off from Florida.</p>
<p>After the company completed integration of the rocket this week, and rolled the super heavy lift rocket to its launch site at Cape Canaveral, the focus turned toward the weather. Conditions at Cape Canaveral Space Force Base have been favorable during the early morning launch windows available to the rocket, but there have been complications offshore.</p>
<p>That's because Blue Origin aims to recover the first stage of the New Glenn rocket, and sea states in the Atlantic Ocean have been unsuitable for an initial attempt to catch the first stage booster on a drone ship. The company has already waived one launch attempt set for 1 am ET (06:00 UTC) on Friday, January 10.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/new-glenn-rocket-is-at-the-launch-pad-waiting-for-calm-seas-to-land/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Every year, thousands of product vendors, journalists, and gadget enthusiasts gather in an unreasonable city to gawk at mostly unrealistic products.</p>
<p>To be of service to our readers, Ars has done the work of looking through hundreds of such items presented at the 2025 Consumer Electronic Show, pulling out the most bizarre, unnecessary, and head-scratching items. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/strange-unique-and-otherwise-noteworthy-pcs-and-pc-accessories-from-ces-2025/">Andrew Cunningham swept across PC and gaming accessories</a>. This writer stuck to goods related to the home.</p>
<p>It's a lie to say it's all a prank, so I snuck in a couple of actually good things for human domiciles announced during CES. But the stuff you'll want to tell your family and friends about in mock disbelief? Plenty of that, still.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/three-bizarre-home-devices-and-a-couple-good-things-at-ces-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Butler's "Darwin among the machines" warned of a future mechanical race that could subjugate humanity.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>While worrying about AI takeover might seem like a modern idea that sprung from <em>War Games</em> or <em>The Terminator</em>, it turns out that a similar concern about machine dominance dates back to the time of the American Civil War, albeit from an English <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3235/pg3235-images.html">sheep farmer</a> living in New Zealand. Theoretically, Abraham Lincoln could have read about AI takeover during his lifetime.</p>
<p>On June 13, 1863, a letter <a href="https://diogenesii.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/darwin-among-the-machines.pdf">published</a> in The Press newspaper of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch">Christchurch</a> warned about the potential dangers of mechanical evolution and called for the destruction of machines, foreshadowing the development of what we now call artificial intelligence—and the backlash against it from people who fear it may threaten humanity with extinction. It presented what may be the first published argument for stopping technological progress to prevent machines from dominating humanity.</p>
<p>Titled "Darwin among the Machines," the letter recently <a href="https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1876982690508910917">popped up</a> again on social media thanks to Peter Wildeford of the <span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Institute for AI Policy and Strategy</span>. The author of the letter, Samuel Butler, submitted it under the pseudonym Cellarius, but later came to publicly embrace his position. The letter drew direct parallels between Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and the rapid development of machinery, suggesting that machines could evolve consciousness and eventually supplant humans as Earth's dominant species.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/161-years-ago-a-new-zealand-sheep-farmer-predicted-ai-doom/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In 2019, astronomer Britt Lundgren of the University of North Carolina Asheville visited the Guggenheim Museum in New York City to take in an exhibit of the works of Swedish painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_af_Klint">Hilma af Klint</a>. Lundgren noted a striking similarity between the abstract geometric shapes in af Klint's work and scientific diagrams in 19th century physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist)">Thomas Young</a>'s <em>Lectures</em> (1807). So began a four-year journey starting at the intersection of science and art that has culminated in a forthcoming paper in the journal Leonardo, making the case for the connection.</p>
<p>Af Klint was formally trained at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and initially focused on drawing, portraits, botanical drawings, and landscapes from her Stockholm studio after graduating with honors. This provided her with income, but her true life's work drew on af Klint's interest in spiritualism and mysticism. She was one of "The Five," a group of Swedish women artists who shared those interests. They regularly organized seances and were admirers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy">theosophical</a> teachings of the time.</p>
<p>It was through her work with The Five that af Klint began experimenting with automatic drawing, driving her to invent her own geometric visual language to conceptualize the invisible forces she believed influenced our world. She painted her first abstract series in 1906 at age 44. Yet she rarely exhibited this work because she believed the art world at the time wasn't ready to appreciate it. Her will requested that the paintings stay hidden for at least 20 years after her death.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/did-hilma-af-klint-draw-inspiration-from-19th-century-physics/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/10/taking-legal-action-to-protect-the-public-from-abusive-ai-generated-content/">said</a> Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit. They then compromised the legitimate accounts of paying customers. They combined those two things to create a fee-based platform people could use.</p>
<h2>A sophisticated scheme</h2>
<p>Microsoft is also suing seven individuals it says were customers of the service.

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meta has reportedly ended diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that influenced staff hiring and training, as well as vendor decisions, effective immediately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to an internal memo <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/10/meta-dei-programs-employees-trump">viewed by Axios </a>and verified by Ars, Meta's vice president of human resources, Janelle Gale, told Meta employees that the shift was due to "legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It's another move by Meta that some view as part of the company's larger effort to align with the incoming Trump administration's politics. In December, Donald Trump promised to crack down on DEI initiatives at companies and on college campuses, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/05/trump-dei-initiatives-colleges">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/meta-kills-diversity-programs-claiming-dei-has-become-too-charged/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Consumer Electronics Show is a reliable source of announcements about iterative updates to PCs and PC components. A few of those announcements are significant enough in some way that they break through all that noise—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/">Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs</a> and their lofty promises about AI-generated frames did that this year, as did Dell's decision <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/the-end-of-an-era-dell-will-no-longer-make-xps-computers/">to kill multiple decades-old PC brands</a> and replace them with a bland series of "Pro/Premium/Plus" tiers.</p>
<p>But CES is also a place where PC companies and accessory makers get a little weird, taking some bigger (and occasionally questionable) swings alongside a big batch of more predictable incremental refreshes. As we've covered the show from afar this year, here are some of the more notable things we've seen.</p>

<p>The strangest CES PCs are usually the ones that try to pull away from "a single screen attached to a keyboard" in some way. Sometimes, those PCs have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/dont-call-it-a-refresh-the-6-most-adventurous-laptop-designs-of-2022/">a second screen stashed somewhere</a>; sometimes, they have a screen that stretches; sometimes, they get rid of the keyboard part and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/asus-takes-a-page-from-lenovo-with-new-foldable-pc/">extend the screen down</a> where you expect that keyboard to be.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/strange-unique-and-otherwise-noteworthy-pcs-and-pc-accessories-from-ces-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.26 of the Rocket Report! Let's pause and reflect on how far the rocket business has come in the last 10 years. On this date in 2015, SpaceX made the first attempt to land a Falcon 9 booster on a drone ship positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. Not surprisingly, the rocket crash-landed. In less than a year and a half, though, SpaceX successfully landed reusable Falcon 9 boosters onshore and offshore, and now has done it nearly 400 times. That was remarkable enough, but we're in a new era now. Within a few days, we could see SpaceX catch its second Super Heavy booster and Blue Origin land its first New Glenn rocket on an offshore platform. Extraordinary.</p>

The combined 138 launches is more than NASA flew the Space Shuttle over three decades. SpaceX will aim to launch even more often in 2025. These missions have far-reaching impacts, supporting Internet coverage for consumers worldwide, launching payloads for NASA and the US military, and testing technology that will take humans back to the Moon and, someday, Mars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/rocket-report-china-launches-refueling-demo-dods-big-appetite-for-hypersonics/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The GNU General Public License (GPL) and its "Lesser" version (LGPL) are widely known and used. Still, every so often, a networking hardware maker has to get sued to make sure everyone knows how it works.</p>
<p>The latest such router company to face legal repercussions is <a href="https://www.avm.de/">AVM</a>, the Berlin-based maker of the most popular home networking products in Germany. Sebastian Steck, a German software developer, bought an <a href="https://en.avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/EN/Manuals/FRITZ_Box/4020_man_en.pdf">AVM Fritz!Box 4020</a> (PDF) and, being a certain type, requested the source code that had been used to generate certain versions of the firmware on it.</p>
<p>According to Steck's complaint (translated to English and <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/static/docs/avm-Complaint_Klageschrift_EN.pdf">provided in PDF</a> by the Software Freedom Conservancy, or SFC), he needed this code to recompile a networking library and add some logging to "determine which programs on the Fritz!Box establish connections to servers on the Internet and which data they send." But Steck was also concerned about AVM's adherence to GPL 2.0 and LGPL 2.1 licenses, under which its FRITZ!OS and various libraries were licensed. The SFC states that it provided a grant to Steck to pursue the matter.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/suing-wi-fi-router-makers-remains-a-necessary-part-of-open-source-license-law/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When an 84-year-old man in Hong Kong was admitted to a hospital for a condition related to an enlarged prostate, doctors noticed something else about him—he was oddly gray, according to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2410226?logout=true">a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>His skin, particularly his face, had an ashen appearance. His fingernails and the whites of his eyes had become silvery. When doctors took a skin biopsy, they could see tiny, dark granules sitting in the fibers of his skin, in his blood vessels, in the membranes of his sweat glands, and in his hair follicles.</p>
<p>A blood test made clear what the problem was: the concentration of silver in his serum was 423 nmol/L, over 40 times the reference level for a normal result, which is less than 10 nmol/L. The man was diagnosed with a rare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Karason">case</a> of generalized argyria, a buildup of silver in the body's tissue that causes a blueish-gray discoloration—which is generally permanent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/man-turns-irreversibly-gray-from-an-unidentified-silver-exposure/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A British judge ruled against a man who wants to excavate a landfill where he says a hard drive with access to thousands of bitcoins was mistakenly dumped over 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Since 2013, James Howells has been hoping to recover a laptop hard drive that he says contains the private key for cryptocurrency which he says he mined in 2009. We wrote about it at the time, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/it-pro-says-he-threw-out-7500-bitcoins-now-worth-7-5-million/">noting</a> that the value of a bitcoin had just passed $1,000, making 7,500 bitcoins worth $7.5 million.</p>
<p>The alleged number of bitcoins has changed a bit, with Howells now saying he lost 8,000 bitcoins. The bitcoin price <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/bitcoin-hits-100000/">exceeded $100,000</a> last month and was worth over $95,636 as of this writing, or $765 million for 8,000 bitcoins.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/judge-ends-mans-11-year-quest-to-dig-up-landfill-and-recover-765m-in-bitcoin/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the last 24 hours or so, the major organizations that keep track of global temperatures have released figures for 2024, and all of them agree: 2024 was the warmest year yet recorded, joining 2023 as an unusual outlier in terms of how rapidly things heated up. At least two of the organizations, the European Union's Copernicus and Berkeley Earth, place the year at about 1.6° C above pre-industrial temperatures, marking the first time that the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5° has been exceeded.</p>
<p>NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration both place the mark at slightly below 1.5° C over pre-industrial temperatures (as defined by the 1850–1900 average). However, that difference largely reflects the uncertainties in measuring temperatures during that period rather than disagreement over 2024.</p>
<h2>It’s hot everywhere</h2>
<p>2023 had set a temperature record largely due to a switch to El Niño conditions midway through the year, which made the second half of the year <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/01/first-results-are-in-2023-temperatures-were-stunningly-warm/">exceptionally hot</a>. It takes some time for that heat to make its way from the ocean into the atmosphere, so the streak of warm months <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/climate-wise-it-was-a-full-year-of-exceptional-months/">continued into 2024</a>, even as the Pacific switched into its cooler La Niña mode.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/its-official-2024-was-the-warmest-year-on-record/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/future-of-jobs-report-2025-jobs-of-the-future-and-the-skills-you-need-to-get-them/">Future of Jobs Report 2025</a>, with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/business/ai-job-losses-by-2030-intl/index.html">CNN immediately highlighting</a> the finding that 40 percent of companies plan workforce reductions due to AI automation. But the report's broader analysis paints a far more nuanced picture than CNN's headline suggests: It finds that AI could create 170 million new jobs globally while eliminating 92 million positions, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs by 2030.</p>
<p>"Half of employers plan to re-orient their business in response to AI," writes the WEF in the report. "Two-thirds plan to hire talent with specific AI skills, while 40% anticipate reducing their workforce where AI can automate tasks."</p>
<p>The survey collected data from 1,000 companies that employ 14 million workers globally. The WEF conducts its employment analysis every two years to help policymakers, business leaders, and workers make decisions about hiring trends.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/ai-could-create-78-million-more-jobs-than-it-eliminates-by-2030-report/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI says it has cut off API access to an engineer whose video of a motorized sentry gun controlled by ChatGPT-powered commands has set off a viral firestorm of concerns about AI-powered weapons.</p>
<p>An engineer going by the handle <a href="https://linktr.ee/sts_3d">sts_3d</a> started posting videos of a motorized, auto-rotating swivel chair project <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sts_3d/video/7402722337553927467">in August</a>. By November, that same assembly appeared to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sts_3d/video/7432775420178631978">seamlessly morph</a> into the basis for a sentry gun that could quickly rotate to arbitrary angles and activate a servo to fire precisely aimed projectiles (though only blanks and simulated lasers are shown being fired in his videos).</p>
<p>Earlier this week, though, sts_3d started getting wider attention for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sts_3d/video/7456640341936966943">a new video</a> showing the sentry gun's integration with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime">OpenAI's real-time API</a>. In the video, the gun uses that ChatGPT integration to aim and fire based on spoken commands from sts_3d and even responds in a chirpy voice afterward.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/viral-chatgpt-powered-sentry-gun-gets-shut-down-by-openai/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It has been more than a week since reports first emerged about a "glowing ring of metal" that fell from the sky and crashed near a remote village in Kenya.</p>
<p>According to the Kenya Space Agency, the object weighed 1,100 pounds (500 kg) and had a diameter of more than 8 feet (2.4 meters) when measured after it landed on December 30. A couple of days later, the space agency confidently reported that the object was a piece of space debris, saying it was a ring that separated from a rocket. "Such objects are usually designed to burn up as they re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere or to fall over unoccupied areas, such as the oceans," the space agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/world/africa/kenya-space-debris-rocket.html">told The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Since those initial reports were published in Western media, a small band of dedicated space trackers have been using open source data to try to identify precisely which space object fell into Kenya. So far, they have not been able to identify the rocket launch to which the large ring can be attributed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/a-glowing-ring-of-metal-fell-to-earth-and-no-one-has-any-idea-what-it-is/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Only 5 percent of US consumers want their next vehicle to be a battery electric vehicle, according to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/global-automotive-consumer-study.html#future-vehicle-intentions">a new survey by Deloitte</a>. The consulting company gathered data from more than 31,000 people across 30 countries as part of its 2025 Global Automotive Consumer Study, and some of the results are rather interesting, as they pertain to technologies like new powertrains, connectivity, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Among US consumers, internal combustion engines (ICE) remain number one, with 62 percent indicating that their next car will not be electrified. Another 1 in 5 would like a hybrid for their next vehicle, with a further 6 percent desiring a plug-in hybrid. (The remaining survey respondents either did not know or wanted some other powertrain option.)</p>
<p>By contrast, only 38 percent of Chinese consumers want to stick with ICE; meanwhile, 27 percent of them want a BEV next. That's a far higher percentage than in other large nations—in Germany, only 14 percent want a BEV; in the UK and Canada, only 8 percent are BEV-bound; and in Japan, the number is a mere 3 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/only-5-percent-of-us-car-buyers-want-an-ev-according-to-survey/">Read full article</a></p>

Discovery (WBD) announced as part of a joint venture in February, will no longer launch, the three companies said today.</p>
<p>The app was supposed to give subscribers access to all three conglomerates' linear channels that show sports, including ABC, Fox, ESPN, FS1, and TruTV. Original content wasn’t expected to launch with the app, but the joint multichannel video programming distributor was expected to represent about 85 percent of the US sports rights market. The app was planned to cost $43 per month.</p>
