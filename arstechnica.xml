                            <![CDATA[<p>On January 1, 2008, at 1:59 AM in Calipatria, California, an earthquake happened. You haven’t heard of this earthquake; even if you had been living in Calipatria, you wouldn’t have felt anything. It was magnitude -0.53, about the same amount of shaking as a truck passing by. Still, this earthquake is notable, not because it was large but because it was small—and yet we know about it.</p>
<p>Over the past seven years, AI tools based on computer imaging have almost completely automated one of the fundamental tasks of seismology: detecting earthquakes. What used to be the task of human analysts—and later, simpler computer programs—can now be done automatically and quickly by machine learning tools.</p>
<p>These machine learning tools can detect smaller earthquakes than human analysts, especially in noisy environments like cities. Earthquakes give valuable information about the composition of the Earth and what hazards might occur in the future.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/like-putting-on-glasses-for-the-first-time-how-ai-improves-earthquake-detection/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An October meeting of a key federal vaccine advisory committee has been canceled without explanation, sparing the evidence-based childhood vaccination schedule from more erosion—at least for now.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning to meet on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251003112109/cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html">October 22 and 23</a>, which would have been the committee's fourth meeting this year. But the meeting schedule was updated in the past week to remove those dates and replace them with "2025 meeting, TBD."</p>
<p>Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services to ask why the meeting was canceled. HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard offered no explanation, only saying that the "official meeting dates and agenda items will be posted on the website once finalized."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/childhood-vaccines-safe-for-a-little-longer-as-cdc-cancels-advisory-meeting/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Scraping the open web for AI training data can have its drawbacks. On Thursday, researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">released</a> a preprint research paper suggesting that large language models like the ones that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can develop backdoor vulnerabilities from as few as 250 corrupted documents inserted into their training data.</p>
<p>That means someone tucking certain documents away inside training data could potentially manipulate how the LLM responds to prompts, although the finding comes with significant caveats.</p>
<p>The research involved training AI language models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters on datasets scaled appropriately for their size. Despite larger models processing over 20 times more total training data, all models learned the same backdoor behavior after encountering roughly the same small number of malicious examples.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-models-can-acquire-backdoors-from-surprisingly-few-malicious-documents/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UPFRItMOgPo?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>New York Comic Con (NYCC) has kicked off with an extended teaser for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Knight_of_the_Seven_Kingdoms_(TV_series)"><em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em></a>, a new <em>Game of Thrones</em> spinoff series based on George R.R. Martin's novella series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Dunk_and_Egg"><em>Tales of Dunk and Egg</em></a>.</p>
<p><em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em> adapts the first novella in the series, <em>The Hedge Knight,</em> and is set 50 years after the events of <em>House of the Dragon</em>. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>A century before the events of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros: a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg. Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter Claffey co-stars as Ser Duncan the Tall, aka a hedge knight named "Dunk," along with Dexter Sol Ansell as Prince Aegon Targaryen, aka "Egg," a child prince and Dunk's squire. The main cast also includes Finn Bennett as Egg's older brother, Prince Aerion "Brightflame" Targaryen; Bertie Carvel as Egg's uncle, Prince Baelor "Breakspear" Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne; Tanzyn Crawford as a Dornish puppeteer named Tanselle; Daniel Ings as Ser Lyonel "Laughing Storm" Baratheon, heir to House Baratheon; and Sam Spruell as Prince Maekar Targaryen, Egg's father.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-teaser-debuts-at-nycc/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For gamers of a certain age, gibberish character sequences like <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/pageofdoom/cheat.html">idkfa</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/simcity-2000/cheats/">torg</a>, <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/genesis/563332-mortal-kombat/cheats">ABACABB</a>, and <a href="https://konami.fandom.com/wiki/Konami_Code">UUDDLRLRBA</a> are akin to long-lost magical incantations. They evoke an era where game developers frequently and routinely let players use cheat codes to customize their gameplay experience with everything from infinite health and instant level selection to <a href="https://tcrf.net/Help:Contents/Terminology/Debug_Mode">full debug menus</a> or <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigHeadMode">gigantic anime-style giant-headed avatars</a>. There were even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/how-the-new-game-genie-lets-you-hack-your-ps3-saves/">external cheat devices</a> that let players hack console games with cheat codes the developers never intended.</p>
<p>While the cheat code's heyday is long in the past, the idea of letting players manipulate their gameplay experiences in similar ways is coming back into fashion for some developers. Last month, Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1966521540130009578">announced</a> that upcoming Switch 2 and Xbox ports of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> would include new "streamlined progression" features. As the name implies, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1nlcmn8/streamlined_progression/">new options menu</a> will give players the opportunity to blaze through the game with infinite health, magic, and money, quicker leveling, maximum damage attacks, and more.</p>

<p>While some responded negatively to what they derisively called a "cheat mode," director Naoki Hamaguchi defended the new options <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-boosts-and-sped-up-cutscenes-can-reduce-playtime-to-under-10-hours-director-hamaguchi-tells-us-why/">in a recent interview with Automaton</a>. "Personally, I like to try many different games just to keep myself up to date, but I don’t really have the time, so I only get so far," he said. "I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content. That’s why I pushed for it."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/why-the-humble-video-game-cheat-code-is-overdue-for-a-comeback/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, Google told US Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) that it would allow creators banned for COVID and election misinformation to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/youtube-will-restore-channels-banned-for-covid-and-election-misinformation/">rejoin the platform</a>. It didn't offer many details in the letter, but now YouTube has <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/second-chances-on-youtube/">explained the restoration process</a>. YouTube's "second chances" are actually more expansive than the letter made it seem. Going forward, almost anyone banned from YouTube will have an opportunity to request a new channel. The company doesn't guarantee approval, but you can expect to see plenty of banned creators back on Google's video platform in the coming months.</p>
<p>YouTube will now allow banned creator to request reinstatement, but this is separate from appealing a ban. If a channel is banned, creators continue to have the option of appealing the ban. If successful, their channel comes back as if nothing happened. After one year, creators will now have the "second chance" option.</p>
<p>"We know many terminated creators deserve a second chance," the blog post reads, noting that YouTube itself doesn't always get things right the first time. The option for getting a new channel will appear in YouTube Studio on the desktop, and Google expects to begin sending out these notices in the coming months. However, anyone terminated for copyright violations is out of luck—Google does not forgive such infringement as easily as it does claiming that COVID is a hoax.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/youtube-explains-how-banned-creators-can-get-a-second-chance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple yesterday announced a plan to comply with a Texas age verification law and warned that changes required by the law will reduce privacy for app users.</p>
<p>"Beginning January 1, 2026, a new state law in Texas—SB2420—introduces age assurance requirements for app marketplaces and developers," Apple said yesterday in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=btkirlj8">post for developers</a>. "While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB2420/id/3237346">Texas App Store Accountability Act</a> requires app stores to verify users' ages and imposes restrictions on those under 18. Apple said that developers will have "to adopt new capabilities and modify behavior within their apps to meet their obligations under the law."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/apple-and-google-reluctantly-comply-with-texas-age-verification-law/">Read full article</a></p>

This week is probably a less good week for Tesla, since the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation has opened yet another preliminary probe into the automaker—the third this year alone.</p>
<p>2025 hadn't been going long before NHTSA announced an <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=PE24033">investigation</a> following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/teslas-remote-parking-under-federal-scrutiny-after-multiple-crashes/">multiple crashes</a> involving Tesla's remote parking features. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/tesla-model-y-door-handles-now-under-federal-safety-scrutiny/">last month</a>, the agency started a <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=PE25010">second</a>, concerning multiple deaths after the company's signature retractable door handles became inoperative after a crash.</p>
<p>Now it's the controversially named "Full Self-Driving" feature in the crosshairs, after dozens of reports of Teslas breaking traffic laws while using this partially automated driving assist.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-fsd-gets-worse-at-driving-nhtsa-opens-new-investigation/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Like an increasing number of sites, Discord requires certain users to provide a photo or scan of their driver's license or other government ID that shows they meet the minimum age requirements in their country. In some cases, Discord allows users to prove their age by providing a selfie that shows their faces (it’s not clear how a face proves someone’s age, but there you go). The social media site imposes these requirements on users who are reported by other users to be under the minimum age for the country they’re connecting from.</p>
<h2>“A substantial risk for identity theft”</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, Discord <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">said</a> that ID images of roughly 70,000 users “may have had government-ID photos exposed” in a recent breach of a third-party service Discord entrusted to manage the data. The affected users had communicated with Discord’s Customer Support or Trust &amp; Safety teams and subsequently submitted the IDs in reviews of age-related appeals.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/discord-says-hackers-stole-government-ids-of-70000-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's social media posts helped The New York Times win its fight to secure a list detailing the billionaire's top-secret security clearances after a US agency tried to block the disclosures by claiming that Musk had a right to privacy.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NYT-v-US-Defense-Counterintelligence-and-Security-Agency-Opinion-10-8-25.pdf">opinion</a> issued Wednesday, US District Judge Denise Cote said that in publicly discussing his security clearances on X—as well as his drug use and foreign contacts—Musk tipped the balance so that the public's substantial interest in the list the NYT sought clearly outweighed "any privacy interest" Musk may have.</p>
<p>"To the extent Musk has a privacy interest in the fact that he holds a security clearance, he has waived it," Cote wrote. Meanwhile, "the public has an interest in knowing whether the leader of SpaceX and Starlink holds the appropriate security clearances," as those companies "continue to provide the federal government with critical national security services and handle sensitive government information."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/musks-x-posts-on-ketamine-putin-spur-release-of-his-security-clearances/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, an inscrutable interstellar interloper made its closest approach to Mars, where a fleet of international spacecraft seek to unravel the red planet's ancient mysteries.</p>
<p>Several of the probes encircling Mars took a break from their usual activities and turned their cameras toward space to catch a glimpse of an object named 3I/ATLAS, a rogue comet that arrived in our Solar System from interstellar space and is now barreling toward perihelion—its closest approach to the Sun—at the end of this month.</p>
<p>This is the third interstellar object astronomers have detected within our Solar System, following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/theres-a-simpler-answer-to-oumuamuas-weird-orbit-outgassing-hydrogen/">1I/ʻOumuamua</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/comet-from-another-solar-system-looks-a-lot-like-our-own/">2I/Borisov</a> discovered in 2017 and 2019. Scientists think interstellar objects routinely transit among the planets, but telescopes have only recently had the ability to find one. For example, the telescope that discovered Oumuamua only came online in 2010.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/10/were-about-to-find-many-more-interstellar-interlopers-heres-how-to-visit-one/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z6wvgrMn8Ow?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Easter Island is famous for its giant monumental statues, called <em>moai</em>, built some 800 years ago and typically mounted on platforms called <em>ahu</em>. Scholars have puzzled over the moai on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island">Easter Island</a> for decades, pondering their cultural significance, as well as how a Stone Age culture managed to carve <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/06/120622-easter-island-statues-moved-hunt-lipo-science-rocked/">and transport statues </a>weighing as much as 92 tons. One hypothesis, championed by archaeologist Carl Lipo of Binghamton University, among others, is that the statues were transported in a vertical position, with workers using ropes to essentially "walk" the moai onto their platforms.</p>
<p>The oral traditions of the people of Rapa Nui certainly include references to the moai "walking" from the quarry to their platforms, such as a song that tells of an early ancestor who made the statues walk. While there have been rudimentary field tests showing it might have been possible, the hypothesis has also generated a fair amount of criticism. So Lipo has co-authored a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440325002328?dgcid=author">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Archaeological Science offering fresh experimental evidence of "walking" moai, based on 3D modeling of the physics and new field tests to recreate that motion.</p>
<p>The first Europeans arrived in the 17th century and found only a few thousand inhabitants on the tiny island (just 14 by 7 miles across) thousands of miles away from any other land. In order to explain the presence of so many moai, the assumption has been that the island was once home to tens of thousands of people<em>. </em>But Lipo thought perhaps the feat could be accomplished with fewer workers. In 2012, Lipo and his colleague, Terry Hunt of the University of Arizona, <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/06/120622-easter-island-statues-moved-hunt-lipo-science-rocked/">showed that</a> you <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312004311?via%3Dihub">could transport</a> a 10-foot, 5-ton moai a few hundred yards with <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/easter-island-statues-walked-out-of-quarry-1.11613" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.nature.com/news/easter-island-statues-walked-out-of-quarry-1.11613" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1759946359083dij" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1759946359083dij">just 18 people</a> and three strong ropes by employing a rocking motion<em>.</em></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/how-easter-islands-giant-statues-walked-to-their-final-platforms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>They say there's no such thing as bad publicity, but the press that Intel has generated in the last year has certainly been testing the boundaries of the aphorism.</p>
<p>Is it good when your company <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1726/intel-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial">posts an annual loss</a> for the first time in almost 40 years? When you're doing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/technology/intel-layoffs-quarterly-report.html">multiple rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/technology/intel-layoffs-25000.html">mass layoffs</a>? When your board <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-steps-down-after-terrible-no-good-very-bad-year/">pushes your CEO into leaving</a>, and starts <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-trump-board-9cc08631">arguing with the new CEO</a> about major strategy decisions almost immediately? When you're either <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-microchip-competitors-challenges-562a42e3">losing or failing to gain</a> market share in areas critical to your bottom line? When you need to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/president-trump-says-intels-new-ceo-must-resign-immediately/">explain to the president</a> why your CEO should keep his job, and then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/intel-details-everything-that-could-go-wrong-with-us-taking-a-10-stake/">explain to investors</a> the many possible downsides of a mercurial president deciding he wants a stake in your company?</p>
<p>I feel like the answer to these questions is "mostly no." Even Intel's recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/nvidia-will-invest-5-billion-in-intel-co-develop-new-server-and-pc-chips/">investment from and partnership with Nvidia</a> came with a tacit admission that Intel was mostly failing to make a dent in AI hardware and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneAPI_(compute_acceleration)">software</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/review-intel-arc-b580-is-a-compelling-if-incredibly-tardy-250-midrange-gpu/">gaming</a> and workstation GPU markets. (Reports that Intel <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/01/2025/intel-amd-foundry-customer-deal">could start manufacturing chips for AMD</a> <em>would</em> be good news, as bizarre as that arrangement would have been at any other point in the two companies' history with one another, but those talks could still fall apart.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/intels-next-generation-panther-lake-laptop-chips-could-be-a-return-to-form/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>MARANELLO, ITALY—The E-Building is one of the newest on Ferrari's sprawling factory complex. One of the first LEED-certified buildings in Italy, the gleaming white interior is the latest in flexible factory design, capable of assembling any model in the automaker's range. And from next year, that will include Ferrari's first electric vehicle.</p>
<p>It's a momentous occasion for Ferrari, and one it's taking its time over—although it has now briefed us on some powertrain and chassis details, we'll have to wait until next year before seeing the interior or exterior of a car that it's calling the Ferrari Elettrica—for now at least.</p>
<p>Ferrari says it considered an all-electric two-seater or even something with occasional rear seats, but the performance benefit of an electric powertrain wasn't enough to offset the added mass for either of those applications. Those calculations did work out in favor of a four-seater, though; the battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 3.1 inches (80 mm) compared to an internal combustion engine powertrain and reduces the polar moment of inertia by 20 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/everything-we-know-about-ferraris-first-electric-vehicle/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This mission, named OSIRIS-APEX, was one of 19 operating NASA science missions the White House proposed canceling in a budget blueprint released earlier this year.</p>
<p>"We were called for cancellation as part to the president's budget request, and we were reinstated and given a plan to move ahead in FY26 (Fiscal Year 2026) just two weeks ago," said Dani DellaGiustina, principal investigator for OSIRIS-APEX at the University of Arizona.

The new financing doubles the total capital raised by Stoke Space, founded in 2020, to $990 million.</p>
<p>The infusion of money will provide the company with "the runway to complete development" of the Nova rocket and demonstrate its capability through its first flights, said Andy Lapsa, the company's co-founder and chief executive, in a news release characterizing the new funding.</p>
<p>Stoke is working toward a 2026 launch of the medium-lift <a href="https://www.stokespace.com/nova/">Nova rocket</a>. The rocket's innovative design is intended to be fully reusable from the payload fairing on down, with a regeneratively cooled heat shield on the vehicle's second stage. In fully reusable mode, Nova will have a payload capacity of 3 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, and up to 7 tons in fully expendable mode.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/stoke-space-gives-us-another-reason-to-take-it-very-seriously/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A 36-year-old man showed up to the emergency department of the Massachusetts General Hospital, severely unwell from a puzzling set of conditions. He had abnormalities in his lungs, intestines, blood, liver, and lymphatic system—and, of course, no single clear explanation. His case was such a riddle that a master clinician with an expertise in clinical reasoning was called in to help unravel it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412539">a case report</a> published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, the expert and the man's other doctors lay out the masterful medical deduction that explained his remarkable case—which had an entirely unremarkable cause.</p>
<p>It all started about two weeks before his hospital visit. A mild, dull pain had developed in the patient's right lower abdomen and back. Nine days later, a fever and body aches also developed. The next day, he went to urgent care, where clinicians gave him intravenous fluids and an intravenous pain reliever. His abdominal pain went away, and he was discharged. But the pain returned over the next few days, and with it came nausea and vomiting. He then started coughing and having trouble breathing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/man-gets-drunk-wakes-up-with-a-medical-mystery-that-nearly-kills-him/">Read full article</a></p>
