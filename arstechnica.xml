                            <![CDATA[<p>A little less than four years from now, a killer asteroid will narrowly fly past planet Earth. This will be a celestial event visible around the world—for a few weeks, Apophis will shine among the brightest objects in the night sky.</p>
<p>The near miss by the large Apophis asteroid in April 2029 offers NASA a golden—and exceedingly rare—opportunity to observe such an object like this up close. Critically, the interaction between Apophis and Earth's gravitational pull will offer scientists an unprecedented chance to study the interior of an asteroid.</p>
<p>This is fascinating for planetary science, but it also has serious implications for planetary defense. In the future, were such an asteroid on course to strike Earth, an effective plan to deflect it would depend on knowing what the interior looks like.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/06/trump-budget-kills-nasas-golden-opportunity-to-see-a-killer-asteroid-up-close/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hackers are exploiting a maximum-severity vulnerability that has the potential to give them complete control over thousands of servers, many of which handle mission-critical tasks inside data centers, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is warning.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, carrying a severity rating of 10 out of a possible 10, resides in the AMI MegaRAC, a widely used firmware package that allows large fleets of servers to be remotely accessed and managed even when power is unavailable or the operating system isn't functioning. These motherboard-attached microcontrollers, known as baseboard management controllers (BMCs), give extraordinary control over servers inside data centers.</p>
<p>Administrators use BMCs to reinstall operating systems, install or modify apps and make configuration changes to large numbers of servers, without physically being on premises and, in many cases, without the servers being turned on. Successful compromise of a single BMC can be used to pivot into internal networks and compromise all other BMCs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/active-exploitation-of-ami-management-tool-imperils-thousands-of-servers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA's Space Launch System appears to have a finite shelf life. The Trump administration wants to cancel it after just three launches, while the preliminary text of a bill making its way through Congress would extend it to five flights.</p>
<p>But chances are low the Space Launch System will making it to nine flights, and if it does, it's questionable if it would reach that point before 2040. The SLS rocket is a core piece of NASA's plan to return US astronauts to the Moon under the Artemis program, but the White House seeks to cancel the program in favor of cheaper commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>For the second time in less than a week, NASA test-fired new propulsion hardware Thursday that the agency would need to keep SLS alive. Last Friday, a new liquid-fueled RS-25 engine ignited on a test stand at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The hydrogen-fueled engine is the first of its kind to be manufactured since the end of the Space Shuttle program. This particular RS-25 engine is assigned to power the fifth flight of the SLS rocket, a mission known as Artemis V.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/nasa-tested-a-new-sls-booster-that-may-never-fly-and-the-end-of-it-blew-off/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Regeneration is a trick many animals, including lizards, starfish, and octopuses, have mastered. Axolotls, a salamander species originating in Mexico, can regrow pretty much everything from severed limbs, through eyes and parts of brain, to the spinal cord. Mammals, though, have mostly lost this ability somewhere along their evolutionary path. Regeneration persisted, in a limited number of tissues, in just a few mammalian species like rabbits or goats.</p>
<p>“We were trying to learn how certain animals lost their regeneration capacity during evolution and then put back the responsible gene or pathway to reactivate the regeneration program,” says Wei Wang, a researcher at the National Institute of Biological Sciences in Beijing. Wang’s team has found one of those inactive regeneration genes, activated it, and brough back a limited regeneration ability to mice that did not have it before.</p>
<h2>Of mice and bunnies</h2>
<p>The idea Wang and his colleagues had was a comparative study to compare how the wound healing process works in regenerating and non-regenerating mammalian species. They chose rabbits as their regenerating mammals and mice as the non-regenerating species. As the reference organ, the team picked the ear pinna. “We wanted relatively simple structure that was easy to observe and yet composed of many different cell types,” Wang says. The test involved punching holes in the ear pinna of rabbits and mice and tracking the wound-repairing process.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/changing-one-gene-can-restore-some-tissue-regeneration-to-mice/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The vaccine panel hand-selected by health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to drop federal recommendations for seasonal flu shots that contain the ethyl-mercury containing preservative thimerosal. The panel did so after hearing a misleading and cherry-picked presentation from an anti-vaccine activist.</p>
<p>There is extensive data from the last quarter century proving that the antiseptic preservative is safe, with no harms identified beyond slight soreness at the injection site, but none of that data was presented during today's meeting.</p>
<p>The significance of the vote is unclear for now. The vast majority of seasonal influenza vaccines currently used in the US—about 96 percent of flu shots in 2024–2025—do not contain thimerosal. The preservative is only included in multi-dose vials of seasonal flu vaccines, where it prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi potentially introduced as doses are withdrawn.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-s-cdc-panel-ditches-some-flu-shots-based-on-anti-vaccine-junk-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Now that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/book-authors-made-the-wrong-arguments-in-meta-ai-training-case-judge-says/">Meta has largely beaten an AI training copyright lawsuit</a> raised by 13 book authors—including comedian Sarah Silverman and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Diaz—the only matter left to settle in that case is whether Meta violated copyright laws by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">torrenting books used to train Llama models</a>.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kadrey-v-Meta-Order-6-25-25.pdf">order</a> that partly grants Meta's motion for summary judgment, judge Vince Chhabria confirmed that Meta and the authors would meet on July 11 to "discuss how to proceed on the plaintiffs’ separate claim that Meta unlawfully distributed their protected works during the torrenting process."</p>
<p>Chhabria's order suggested that authors may struggle to win this part of the fight, too, due to a lack of evidence, as there has not yet been much discovery on this issue that was raised so late in the case. But he also warned that Meta was wrong to argue its torrenting was completely "irrelevant" to whether its copying of books was fair use.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-rejects-metas-claim-that-torrenting-is-irrelevant-in-ai-copyright-case/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-powered-artifacts">announced</a> a new feature that expands its Artifacts document management system into the basis of a personal AI app gallery resembling something from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/the-rise-and-fall-of-adobe-flash/">Flash game era</a> of the early 2000s—though these apps run on modern web code rather than Adobe's defunct plugin.</p>
<p>Using plain English dialogue, users can build and share interactive applications <a href="https://claude.ai/artifacts">directly within</a> Claude's chatbot interface using a new API capability that lets artifacts interact with Claude itself. Claude is an AI assistant similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>Claude has been capable of building web apps for some time, but Anthropic has put renewed focus on the feature that many have overlooked. "I'm amused that Anthropic turned 'we added a window.claude.complete() function to Artifacts' into what looks like a major new product launch," <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/ai-powered-apps-with-claude/">wrote</a> independent AI researcher Simon Willison in a blog post, "but I can't say it's bad marketing for them to do that!"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-summons-the-spirit-of-flash-games-for-the-ai-age/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Broadcom stopped selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">VMware perpetual licenses</a> in November 2023 in favor of pushing a small number of VMware SKUs that feature multiple VMware offerings. Since Broadcom is forcefully bundling VMware products, the costs associated with running VMware have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/">skyrocketed</a>, with customers frequently citing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">300 percent price hikes</a> and some firms claiming even larger increases. As a result, some VMware users have opted to keep using VMware perpetual licenses, even though Broadcom refuses to renew <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/broadcom-tried-to-jack-vmware-prices-by-1050-percent-att-claims/">most</a> of those clients’ support services.</p>
<p>This year, Broadcom started sending such VMware users cease-and-desist letters [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025.05.07-12.26.01-SNAGIT-0038.pdf">PDF</a>], telling organizations to stop using any maintenance releases/updates, minor releases, major releases/upgrades extensions, enhancements, patches, bug fixes, or security patches (except for zero-day security patches) that VMware issued since the user’s support contract ended.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/vmware-perpetual-license-holder-receives-audit-letter-from-broadcom/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's new 13-inch Surface Laptop is an odd one. It's inarguably a step down in every respect from last year's 13.8-inch Surface Laptop. But it's also too good (and too expensive) to be considered a replacement for the Surface Laptop Go, the company's perennially overpriced and underspecced entry-level laptop. It's cheaper than last year's Surfaces, but mostly because Microsoft gave those devices a de facto price hike by killing the entry-level configurations of those PCs.</p>
<p>We're left with a laptop that's perfectly fine or even great, depending on what you want. It's relatively affordable for what is, a sort of MacBook Air-ish, just-the-basics portable computer. But it's <em>such</em> a step down from the $999 laptop Microsoft released just last year that it's hard not to see the entire laptop as one big series of compromises.</p>
<h2>Where does the 13-inch Surface Laptop belong?</h2>
<p>Despite just calling it the "Surface Laptop, 13-inch," Microsoft clearly considers this to be an entirely different sub-class of laptop rather than a continuation of the flagship Surface Laptop or the lower-end Surface Go. The system identifies itself to Windows as "Surface Laptop 13in 1st Ed with Snapdragon," where the 13.8- and 15-inch Surface Laptops are both labeled as 7th edition devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/review-microsofts-13-inch-surface-laptop-isnt-bad-but-it-is-a-step-down/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/this-archaeologist-built-a-replica-boat-to-sail-like-the-vikings/">we reported</a> on a Swedish archaeologist who spent the last three years sailing the fjords in a replica boat similar to those the Vikings may have used. Not to be outdone, Japanese researchers have followed suit, building their own seaworthy dugout canoe with Paleolithic-era tools to cross between Taiwan and Yonaguni Island, where one of the world’s strongest ocean currents, the Kuroshio, remains active.</p>
<p>They presented their findings in two new papers published in the journal Science Advances. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv5507">One describes</a> the experimental trial, and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv5508">the other</a> involves numerical simulations to investigate the general conditions needed for the crossing. The successfully re-enacted voyage suggests that early modern humans likely had a high level of strategic seafaring knowledge. (You can watch a 90-minute documentary about the voyage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb_jZ4bbKyg">here</a>.) This would explain the presence of archaeological evidence that Paleolithic people made the crossing some 30,000 years ago without the aid of maps, metal tools, or modern boats.</p>
<p>“We initiated this project with simple questions: ‘How did Paleolithic people arrive at such remote islands as Okinawa? How difficult was their journey? And what tools and strategies did they use?’” <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/press/z0508_00414.html">said co-author Yousuke Kaifu</a> of the University of Tokyo. “Archaeological evidence such as remains and artifacts can’t paint a full picture as the nature of the sea is that it washes such things away. So we turned to the idea of experimental archaeology, in a similar vein to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon-Tiki_expedition">Kon-Tiki expedition</a> of 1947 by Norwegian explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl">Thor Heyerdahl</a>.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/testing-ancient-paleolithic-migration-with-a-replica-canoe/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, Google has transformed its web search experience with AI, driving toward a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/">zero-click experience</a>. Now, the same AI focus is coming to YouTube, and Premium subscribers can get a preview of the new search regime. Select searches on the video platform will now produce an AI-generated results carousel with a collection of relevant videos. Even if you don't pay for YouTube, AI is still coming for you with an expansion of Google's video chatbot.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-youtube-ai-tools-summer-2025/">Google says</a> the new AI search feature, which appears at the top of the results page, will include multiple videos, along with an AI summary of each. You can tap the video thumbnails to begin playing them right from the carousel. The summary is intended to extract the information most relevant to your search query, so you may not even have to watch the videos.</p>
<p>The AI results carousel is only a test right now, and it's limited to YouTube Premium subscribers. If you're paying for Premium, you can enable the feature on YouTube's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new">experimental page</a>. While the feature is entirely opt-in, that probably won't last long. Like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">AI Overviews in search</a>, this feature will take precedence over organic search results and get people interacting with Google's AI, and that's the driving force behind most of the company's decisions lately.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/google-begins-rolling-out-ai-search-in-youtube/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Battery electrode materials need to do a lot of things well. They need to be conductors to get charges to and from the ions that shuttle between the electrodes. They also need to have an open structure that allows the ions to move around before they reach a site where they can be stored. The storage of lots of ions also causes materials to expand, creating mechanical stresses that can cause the structure of the electrode material to gradually decay.</p>
<p>Because it's hard to get all of these properties from a single material, many electrodes are composite materials, with one chemical used to allow ions into and out of the electrode, another to store them, and possibly a third that provides high conductivity. Unfortunately, this can create new problems, with breakdowns at the interfaces between materials slowly degrading the battery's capacity.</p>
<p>Now, a team of researchers is proposing a material that seemingly does it all. It's reasonably conductive, it allows lithium ions to move around and find storage sites, and it's made of cheap and common elements. Perhaps best of all, it undergoes self-healing, smoothing out damage across charge/discharge cycles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/researchers-develop-a-battery-cathode-material-that-does-it-all/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At 1pm on Thursday, we encourage you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/BtNXI-xG1Po">join us for a live chat with Zeke Hausfather</a>, a climate scientist and researcher at Berkeley Earth. We'll talk a bit about how he got into climate science and ended up at Berkeley Earth and the role that organization plays in the world of climate science. It was launched by a physicist who was somewhat skeptical of the work being done by climate scientists, but it has evolved into one of the key groups that does the math needed to track the planet's temperatures.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, those temperatures have seen a remarkable rise to record highs, at one point setting a yearlong string where every month set a record for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/climate-wise-it-was-a-full-year-of-exceptional-months/">warmest instance of that month on record</a>. The rise leaves us at risk of exceeding key climate targets much earlier than expected and has left the climate science community scrambling to explain the intensity of the heat. So we plan to ask Zeke a bit about what scientists are thinking about the dramatic nature of these changes, attempts to explore the relationship between temperatures, and things like tipping points and individual weather events.</p>
<p>And all that leads to the key question: What does this tell us about where our climate is likely to go over the rest of this century?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ars-live-climate-science-in-an-increasingly-hot-world/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The four people at the helm of America's space agency held a town hall meeting with employees Wednesday, fielding questions about downsizing, layoffs, and proposed budget cuts that threaten to undermine NASA's mission and prestige.</p>
<p>Janet Petro, NASA's acting administrator, addressed questions from an auditorium at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC. She was joined by Brian Hughes, the agency's chief of staff, a political appointee who was formerly a Florida-based consultant active in city politics and in Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Two other senior career managers, Vanessa Wyche and Casey Swails, were also on the stage.</p>
<p>They tried to put a positive spin on the situation at NASA. Petro, Wyche, and Swails are civil servants, not Trump loyalists. None of them looked like they wanted to be there. The town hall was not publicized outside of NASA ahead of time, but live video of the event was available—unadvertised—on an <a href="https://video.ibm.com/channel/KKpgkydqfQr">obscure NASA streaming website</a>. The video has since been removed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/during-a-town-hall-wednesday-nasa-officials-on-stage-looked-like-hostages/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal vaccine panel entirely hand-selected by health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gathered for its first meeting Wednesday—and immediately announced that it would re-evaluate the entire childhood vaccination schedule, as well as the one for adults.</p>
<p>The meeting overall was packed with anti-vaccine talking points and arguments from the new panel members, confirming public health experts' fears that the once-revered panel is now critically corrupted and that Kennedy's controversial picks will only work to fulfill his long-standing anti-vaccine agenda.</p>
<h2>Controversial committee</h2>
<p>An hour before the meeting began, the American Academy of Pediatrics came out swinging against the new panel, saying that the panel's work is "no longer a credible process." The organization shunned the meeting, refusing to send a liaison to the panel's meeting, which it has done for decades.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/all-childhood-vaccines-in-question-after-first-meeting-of-rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trump-org-launches-47-month-wireless-service-teases-odd-499-phone/">Trump phone</a> was announced last week with a claim that the device would be made entirely in America, and people were rightly skeptical. Trump Mobile's $500 T1 Phone "is a sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance and proudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best from their mobile carrier," the Trump Organization <a href="https://www.trump.com/media/trump-mobile-launches-a-bold-new-wireless-service">said</a> in a press release.</p>
<p>But with electronics supply chain experts <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/mobile-experts-skeptical-of-trump-t1-phone-made-in-america-claims">casting doubt</a> on the feasibility of designing and building an American-made phone in a short span of time, Trump Mobile's website doesn't currently promise an American-made phone. The <a href="https://trumpmobile.com/t1-phone">website</a> says the T1 is "designed with American values in mind," that it is "brought to life right here in the USA," and that there are "American hands behind every device."</p>
<p>The Trump Mobile website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617004920/https://trumpmobile.com/">previously said</a>, "Our MADE IN THE USA 'T1 Phone' is available for pre-order now." The phone was initially supposed to be available in August, but the date was changed to September, and now the website simply says it will be available "later this year."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/after-a-week-trump-mobile-drops-claim-that-trump-phone-is-made-in-the-usa/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Bluetooth trackers have existed for quite a while, but Apple made them worthwhile when it enlisted every iPhone to support AirTags. The tracking was so reliable that Apple had to add <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/apple-plans-airtag-alert-upgrades-to-prevent-stalking-and-other-crimes/">anti-stalking features.</a> And although there are just as many Android phones out there, Google's version of mobile device tracking, known as Find Hub, has been comparatively spotty. Now, Google is about to offer users a choice that could fix Bluetooth tracking on Android.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-find-hub-setup-screen-3570944/">Android Authority</a>, Google is preparing to add a new screen to the Android setup process. This change, integrated with Play Services version 25.24, has yet to roll out widely, but it will allow anyone setting up an Android phone to choose a more effective method of tracking that will bolster Google's network. This is included in the Play Services changelog as, "You can now configure Find Hub when setting up your phone, allowing the device to be located remotely."</p>
<p>Trackable devices like AirTags and earbuds work by broadcasting a Bluetooth LE identifier, which phones in the area can see. Our always-online smartphones then report the approximate location of that signal, and with enough reports, the owner can pinpoint the tag. Perhaps wary of the privacy implications, Google rolled out its Find Hub network (previously Find My Device) with harsh restrictions on where device finding would work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/googles-spotty-find-hub-network-could-get-better-thanks-to-a-small-setup-tweak/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Critics are increasingly branding Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a failure, including lawmakers fiercely debating how much funding to allot next year to the controversial agency.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats sparred over DOGE's future at a DOGE subcommittee hearing, <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/06/lawmakers-spar-over-doge-republicans-look-lock-cuts/406278/">according to NextGov</a>, a news site for federal IT workers. On one side, Republicans sought to "lock in" and codify the "DOGE process" for supposedly reducing waste and fraud in government, and on the other, Democrats argued that DOGE has "done the opposite" of its intended mission and harmed Americans in the process.</p>
<p>DOGE has "led to poor services, a brain drain on our federal government, and it’s going to cost taxpayers money long term," Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.) argued.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/is-doge-doomed-to-fail-some-experts-are-ready-to-call-it/">Read full article</a></p>
