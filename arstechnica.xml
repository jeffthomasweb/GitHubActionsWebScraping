                            <![CDATA[<p>Evolution has adapted the digits of mammals for an enormous range of uses, from our opposable thumbs to the spindly digits that support bat wings to the robust bones that support the hoofs of horses. But how we got digits in the first place hasn't been entirely clear. The fish that limbed vertebrates evolved from don't have obvious digit equivalents, and the most common types of fish just have a large collection of rays supporting their fins.</p>
<p>Despite this uncertainty, we have identified some genes that seem to be essential for both digit formation and the development of rays in the fins of fish, suggesting that there are parallels between the two. But a new study suggests that these parallels are a bit of an accident, and digits come by re-deploying a genetic network that controls a completely different process: the formation of the cloaca, a single organ that handles all of the fish's excretion.</p>
<h2>Hox genes and digits</h2>
<p>One of the key regulators of limb development is a set of genes called homeobox proteins, which attach to DNA and regulate the activity of nearby genes. In animals, many of these homeobox, or hox genes, are formed into clusters. Mammals have four clusters of hox genes, each of which encodes roughly 10 individual homeobox proteins. The cluster helps to organize where the hox genes are active, with the genes at one end of the cluster being active at the front of an embryo, and those at the other end active at the tail.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/distinct-digits-may-have-evolved-by-using-dna-that-makes-the-cloaca/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic's AI models could potentially help spies analyze classified documents, but the company draws the line at domestic surveillance. That restriction is reportedly making the Trump administration angry.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Semafor <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/09/17/2025/anthropic-irks-white-house-with-limits-on-models-uswhite-house-with-limits-on-models-use">reported</a> that Anthropic faces growing hostility from the Trump administration over the AI company's restrictions on law enforcement uses of its Claude models. Two senior White House officials told the outlet that federal contractors working with agencies like the FBI and Secret Service have run into roadblocks when attempting to use Claude for surveillance tasks.</p>
<p>The friction stems from Anthropic's <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup">usage policies</a> that prohibit domestic surveillance applications. The officials, who spoke to Semafor anonymously, said they worry that Anthropic enforces its policies selectively based on politics and uses vague terminology that allows for a broad interpretation of its rules.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/white-house-officials-reportedly-frustrated-by-anthropics-law-enforcement-ai-limits/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to roll back access to lifesaving vaccines for children, and has refused to even speak with staff scientists and subject-matter experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about evidence-based recommendations. That's according to former CDC officials who testified before the Senate on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) called ex-CDC director Susan Monarez to review the chaos that has engulfed the public health agency under Kennedy. Monarez, a microbiologist and long-serving federal employee, led the CDC as the first Senate-confirmed director for just 29 days before her <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/report-cdc-director-being-ousted-just-weeks-after-senate-confirmation/">dramatic ouster last month</a>. She appeared before the HELP committee alongside Debra Houry, the former chief medical officer for the CDC. Houry had worked at the agency for a decade—spanning four administrations and six directors— before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/cdc-spiraled-into-chaos-this-week-heres-where-things-stand/">resigning in protest against Kennedy's leadership</a> soon after Monarez's ouster.</p>
<h2>Monarez’s ouster</h2>
<p>Much of their testimony today was alarming, but not surprising. Upon her exit, Monarez claimed that she was fired because she refused Kennedy's demand that she agree in advance to approve changes to the CDC's childhood vaccine recommendations regardless of whether any scientific evidence supported the changes. She also claimed that Kennedy demanded that she fire CDC scientific leadership without cause, which she also refused to do. Similarly, when Houry resigned, she said Kennedy was censoring science, steamrolling CDC experts, and spreading misinformation. In the hearing today, the two stood by their previous comments and provided more details.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/rfk-jrs-anti-vaccine-delusions-not-science-steer-cdc-now-ex-director-testifies/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>When I was a child, <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fsimcity_2000_special_edition"><em>SimCity 2000</em></a> felt like a fun, animated set of urban-themed Lego blocks to tinker with. Revisiting the game roughly three decades later, though, I've found the weight of my adult responsibilities tempering my role as god-mayor of a tiny metropolis.</p>
<p>The tough economics of establishing a thriving city barely concerned me as a child. Rather than building up a durable tax base from a slowly growing city of happy citizens, I'd usually <a href="https://gamegenie.com/cheats/mac/SimCity2000.html">type in an infinite money cheat</a> or load up the handy <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/2422/simcity-2000-urban-renewal-kit/">Urban Renewal Kit expansion</a> to build whatever I wanted, wherever I wanted, as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Thus unleashed, my childhood self would go mad with unchecked power, petulantly turning dials just to see what happened to the citizens in my virtual ant farm. Sometimes I'd try to arrange a repeating grid of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solarpunk/comments/wp43ua/sim_city_2000_arcology/">fancy arcologies</a> and police stations, trying to create a regimented utopia out of the game's most expensive (and therefore "best") building type. More often, I'd play with the far edges of the simulation, crowding residential areas next to polluting heavy industry or letting entire neighborhoods go without fire protection and waiting to see how long it took for things to fall apart.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/thirty-years-later-simcity-2000-hasnt-changed-but-i-have/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration yesterday issued a lengthier denial of a whistleblower's allegation that DOGE officials at the Social Security Administration (SSA) copied the agency's database to an insecure cloud system. The allegation centers on the Numerical Identification System (NUMIDENT) database containing Americans' personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>The cloud location described by the whistleblower report "is actually a secured server in the agency's cloud infrastructure which historically has housed this data and is continuously monitored and overseen—SSA's standard practice," said a <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_from_commissioner_bisignano_to_chairman_crapo_091625.pdf">letter</a> sent yesterday to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).</p>
<p>The letter was sent by SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, a Trump appointee who was previously CEO of the financial technology company Fiserv. It came in response to <a href="https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-requests-information-on-social-security-data-protections">Crapo's request</a> for information.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/trump-admin-denies-doge-put-social-security-data-into-insecure-cloud-system/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Like the rest of its Big Tech cadre, Google has spent lavishly on developing generative AI models. Google's AI can clean up your text messages and summarize the web, but the company is constantly looking to prove that its generative AI has true intelligence. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) helps make the point. Google says Gemini 2.5 participated in the 2025 ICPC World Finals, turning in a gold medal performance. According to Google this marks "a significant step on our path toward artificial general intelligence."</p>
<p>Every year, thousands of college-level coders participate in the ICPC event, facing a dozen deviously complex coding and algorithmic puzzles over five grueling hours. This is the largest and longest-running competition of its type. To compete in the ICPC, Google connected Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to a remote online environment approved by the ICPC. The human competitors were given a head start of 10 minutes before Gemini began "thinking."</p>
<p>According to Google, it did not create a freshly trained model for the ICPC like it did for the similar <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/google-deepmind-earns-gold-in-international-math-olympiad-with-new-gemini-ai/">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> (IMO) earlier this year. The Gemini 2.5 AI that participated in the ICPC is the same general model that we see in other Gemini applications. However, it was "enhanced" to churn through thinking tokens for the five-hour duration of the competition in search of solutions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/google-gemini-earns-gold-medal-in-icpc-world-finals-coding-competition/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Sony Pictures has dropped a trailer for its upcoming horror comedy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(2025_film)"><em>Anaconda</em></a>, a meta-reboot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(1997_film)">1997 campy cult classic</a>—and frankly, it looks like a lot of fun. Starring Paul Rudd and Jack Black, the film will arrive in theaters on Christmas Day.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the 1997 film below.)</strong></p>
<p>The original <em>Anaconda</em> was your basic B-movie creature feature, only with an all-star cast and better production values. The plot revolved around a documentary film crew (Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Jonathan Hyde, and Owen Wilson) who travel to the Amazon in search of a long-lost Indigenous tribe. They take on a stranded Paraguayan snake hunter named Serone (Jon Voight, affecting a hilariously bad foreign accent), who strong-arms them into helping him hunt down a 25-foot green anaconda. He wants to capture the animal alive, thinking he can sell it for over $1 million.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/trailer-for-anaconda-meta-reboot-leans-into-the-laughs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/car-safety-experts-at-nhtsa-which-regulates-tesla-axed-by-doge/">began wielding its ax</a> at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year, many believed this was done to weaken the agency's oversight over Tesla. But despite the Tesla CEO's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/elon-musk-to-exit-government-upset-that-trump-bill-undermines-doges-work/">sometimes-close</a> relationship with the Trump administration, it appears there is still some independence left within NHTSA: earlier this week, the agency opened a new safety investigation into the door handles of the Tesla Model Y.</p>
<p>The timing may not be coincidental; last week, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/flush-door-handles-are-the-car-industrys-latest-safety-problem/">the safety hazard</a> posed by badly designed retractable door handles entered the spotlight thanks to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/">a comprehensive report</a> by Bloomberg's Dana Hull. As Hull detailed, Tesla's door handles rely on the car's 12 V battery to work. Should this fail, there is no way to open the doors from the outside, something that has cost lives as first responders have been unable to free occupants from burning Teslas.</p>
<p>While front seat passengers have easily accessible interior emergency door releases, some Teslas lack any way of opening the rear doors from the inside after a crash. Other, more recent Models 3 and Y have manual releases located under a panel underneath the rear seat.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/tesla-model-y-door-handles-now-under-federal-safety-scrutiny/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Today’s contribution comes from supply chain analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who usually has some insight into what Apple is testing and manufacturing. Kuo <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538">says</a> that touchscreen MacBook Pros are “expected to enter mass production by late 2026,” and that the devices will also shift to using OLED display panels instead of the Mini LED panels on current-generation MacBook Pros.</p>
<p>Kuo says that Apple’s interest in touchscreen Macs comes from “long-term observation of iPad user behavior.” Apple’s tablet hardware launches in the last few years have also included keyboard and touchpad accessories, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/ipados-26-preview-the-rare-software-update-that-makes-most-old-hardware-feel-new/">this year’s iPadOS 26 update</a> in particular has helped to blur the line between the touch-first iPad and the keyboard-and-pointer-first Mac. In other words, Apple has already acknowledged that both kinds of input can be useful when combined in the same device; taking that same jump on the Mac feels like a natural continuation of work Apple is already doing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/latest-round-of-credible-touchscreen-macbook-rumors-point-to-a-2026-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Author Laurie Gwen Shapiro chats with Ars about her latest book, <em>The Aviator and the Showman</em>.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Famed aviator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart">Amelia Earhart</a> has captured our imaginations for nearly a century, particularly her disappearance in 1937 during an attempt to become the first female pilot to circumnavigate the globe. Earhart was a complicated woman, highly skilled as a pilot yet with a tendency toward carelessness. And her marriage to a flamboyant publisher with a flair for marketing may have encouraged that carelessness and contributed to her untimely demise, according to a fascinating new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aviator-Showman-Earhart-Marriage-American/dp/0593295900"><em>The Aviator and the Showman: Amelia Earhart, George Putnam, and the Marriage that Made an American Icon</em></a>.</p>
<p>Author Laurie Gwen Shapiro is a longtime Earhart fan. A documentary filmmaker and journalist, she first read about Earhart in a short biography distributed by Scholastic Books. "I got a little obsessed with her when I was younger," Shapiro told Ars. The fascination faded as she got older and launched her own career. But she rediscovered her passion for Earhart while writing her 2018 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stowaway-Young-Extraordinary-Adventure-Antarctica/dp/1476753865/"><em>The Stowaway</em></a>, about a young man who stowed away on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd">Admiral Richard Byrd</a>'s first voyage to Antarctica. The marketing mastermind behind the boy's journey and his subsequent (ghost-written) memoir was publisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Putnam">George Palmer Putnam</a>, Earhart's eventual husband.</p>
<p>The fact that Earhart started out as Putnam's mistress contradicted Shapiro's early squeaky-clean image of Earhart and drove her to delve deeper into the life of this extraordinary woman. "I was less interested in how she died than how she lived," said Shapiro. "Was she a good pilot? Was she a good, kind person? Was this a real marriage? The mystery of Amelia Earhart is not how she died, but how she lived."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/new-amelia-earhart-bio-delves-into-her-unconventional-marriage/">Read full article</a></p>

It may take time to get used to the new "Liquid Glass" look, but it’s easier to appreciate the pared-down controls.</p>
<p>Beyond a glassy, bubbly new design, the update’s flashiest new features also include new Apple Intelligence AI integration that varies in usefulness, from fluffy new Genmoji abilities to a nifty live translation feature for Phones, Messages, and FaceTime.</p>
<p>New tech is often bogged down with AI-based features that prove to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/ai-marketing-hype-is-coming-for-your-favorite-gadgets/">overhyped</a>, unreliable, or just not that useful. iOS 26 brings a little of each, so in this review, we’ll home in on the iOS updates that will benefit both mainstream and power users the most.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/ios-26-review-a-practical-yet-playful-update/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, NASA said ground teams are evaluating backup plans that might still allow the Cygnus spacecraft to reach the space station, just not on schedule. The problem arose early Tuesday when the spacecraft's main engine shut down earlier than expected during two burns to boost the ship's orbit for its rendezvous with the ISS, according to NASA.</p>
<p>Officials didn't release any other details about the engine problem, but all other systems on the Cygnus XL spacecraft are performing as designed, NASA said. The agency said a new arrival date and time at the space station is "under review."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/a-record-supply-load-wont-reach-the-international-space-station-as-scheduled/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, Trump confirmed that he has extended the deadline to December 16 for TikTok owner ByteDance to divest ownership to comply with a law designed to block China from spying on US users or manipulating TikTok's algorithm to influence Americans.</p>
<p>The president claimed that the extension allows time to finalize a deal that sources <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/details-emerge-on-u-s-china-tiktok-deal-594e009f">told The Wall Street Journal</a> would shift 80 percent ownership to "an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz."

                            <![CDATA[<p>Congressional lawmakers are skeptical that the Boar's Head deli meat plant at the center of a deadly <em>Listeria </em>outbreak last year will be fit to reopen after recent inspections at three other Boar's Head facilities turned up similarly alarming sanitation problems—including mold, condensation on ceilings, overflowing trash, meat residue caked onto equipment and walls, and employees failing to wash their hands.</p>
<p><a href="https://delauro.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/delauro.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/food-safety-caucus-letter-boar-s-head-plant-reopening-09.15.25.pdf">In a letter dated September 15</a>, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and nine other Congress members noted reports that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/boars-head-to-reopen-plant-as-mold-and-funky-meat-problems-pop-up-elsewhere/">Boar's Head plans to reopen the Jarratt, Virginia, facility in the coming months</a>. The plant—and particularly the liverwurst product made there—was determined to be the source of a <em>Listeria</em> outbreak that spanned May to September of last year, sickening <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24/investigation.html">at least 61 people across 19 states</a>. Of those 61 people, 60 were hospitalized and 10 died. The company recalled <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/">more than 7 million pounds of meat</a>.</p>
<p>Amid the outbreak, it came to light that inspectors with the US Department of Agriculture had found dozens of stomach-turning sanitation violations at the plant, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/blood-puddles-mold-tainted-meat-bugs-boars-head-inspections-are-horrifying/">including mold, condensation dripping on meats, insects, and puddles of blood</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/repeat-creepy-meat-problems-at-boars-head-plants-draw-congressional-scrutiny/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Although cars are much safer—for their occupants at least—than they used to be, that has come at a cost: added weight. The problem is exacerbated in electric vehicles and their heavy battery packs; rare is the EV we've driven that weighs less than 5,000 lbs (2,267 kg).</p>
<p>Hence my interest in the Altair Enlighten award, an annual prize for advances in lightweighting and sustainability given out by the AI company together with the Center for Automotive Research, which offers a look at some of the avenues automakers and suppliers are exploring to take some of the weight and carbon footprint out of tomorrow's new cars.</p>
<p>Lucid Motors has won in two separate categories. It takes the Sustainable Computing prize for speeding up new car development with a way for engineers to test iterated designs within their existing CAD environment rather than having to switch to a different tool. Lucid also won the Responsible AI prize for using AI to help predict crash testing well before the physical prototype stage—this let Lucid reduce the number of iterations it went through and the test waste and materials it used.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/an-antidote-to-fat-heavy-cars-check-out-these-lightweighting-awards/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1ncn0go/evolving_moderation_on_reddit_reshaping_boundaries/">said</a> the change only affects “0.1 percent of our active mods” and will help enable “diverse perspectives and experiences.” But mods whom Ars Technica spoke with have different views.</p>
<h2>New limits on how many subreddits users can moderate</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1ncn0go/evolving_moderation_on_reddit_reshaping_boundaries/">A recent post</a> on the r/modnews subreddit announced plans for new restrictions on how many subreddits users can moderate. Those who currently don’t meet those restrictions will be asked to leave their post(s) or seek an exemption(s). Reddit hasn’t finalized the requirements for exemptions but says it’s working on them with moderators.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/mods-react-as-reddit-kicks-some-of-them-out-again-this-will-break-the-site/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/building-towards-age-prediction/">announced plans</a> to develop an automated age-prediction system that will determine whether ChatGPT users are over or under 18, automatically directing younger users to a restricted version of the AI chatbot. The company also confirmed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-announces-parental-controls-for-chatgpt-after-teen-suicide-lawsuit/">parental controls</a> will launch by the end of September.</p>
<p>In a companion blog post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://openai.com/index/teen-safety-freedom-and-privacy/">acknowledged</a> the company is explicitly "prioritizing safety ahead of privacy and freedom for teens," even though it means that adults may eventually need to verify their age to use a more unrestricted version of the service.</p>
<p>"In some cases or countries we may also ask for an ID," Altman wrote. "We know this is a privacy compromise for adults but believe it is a worthy tradeoff." Altman admitted that "not everyone will agree with how we are resolving that conflict" between user privacy and teen safety.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/chatgpt-may-soon-require-id-verification-from-adults-ceo-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon agreed to offer $20-per-month broadband service to people with low incomes in California in exchange for a merger approval.</p>
<p>In a bid to complete its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/frontiers-3-million-users-to-become-verizon-users-in-latest-telco-merger/">$9.6 billion purchase</a> of Frontier Communications, Verizon committed to offering $20 fiber-to-the-home service with symmetrical speeds of 300Mbps. Verizon also committed to offering a $20 fixed wireless service with download speeds of 100Mbps and upload speeds of 20Mbps.</p>
<p>Verizon would be required to offer the plans for at least 10 years, according to a <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M578/K765/578765845.PDF">joint motion</a> to approve the settlement agreement. After three years, Verizon would need to "make commercially reasonable efforts" to increase the speeds "while retaining the $20 price point." The joint motion filed by Verizon and the California Public Advocates Office seeks approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/verizon-to-offer-20-broadband-in-california-to-obtain-merger-approval/">Read full article</a></p>
