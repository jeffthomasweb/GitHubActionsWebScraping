                            <![CDATA[<p>Google owner Alphabet today agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit that President Trump filed against YouTube in 2021. Trump sued YouTube over his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/youtube-suspends-trumps-account-disables-comments-indefinitely/">account being suspended</a> after Trump supporters' January 6 attack on the US Capitol.</p>
<p>Alphabet agreed to pay $22 million "to settle and resolve with Plaintiff Donald J. Trump... which he has directed to be contributed, on his behalf, to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom," a court filing said. Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/the-white-house-announces-white-house-ballroom-construction-to-begin/">recently announced plans</a> for the 90,000-square-foot ballroom.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.386486/gov.uscourts.cand.386486.178.0_1.pdf">settlement notice</a>, filed today in US District Court for the Northern District of California, said Alphabet will also pay $2.5 million to settle claims with plaintiffs the American Conservative Union, Andrew Baggiani, Austen Fletcher, Maryse Veronica Jean-Louis, Frank Valentine, Kelly Victory, and Naomi Wolf. Under the settlement, Alphabet admits no wrongdoing and the parties agreed to dismiss the case.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/youtube-pays-24-5m-to-settle-trump-lawsuit-over-january-2021-suspension/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The booster stage for Firefly Aerospace's next Alpha rocket was destroyed Monday in a fiery accident on the company's vertical test stand in Central Texas.</p>
<p>Engineers were testing the rocket before shipment to Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, to prepare for launch later this year with a small commercial satellite for Lockheed Martin. Activities at the vertical test stand in Briggs, Texas, include propellant loading and test-firings of the booster's four kerosene-fueled engines. The rocket was undergoing one of these test-firings on Monday when the accident occurred.</p>
<p>Firefly released a statement confirming the rocket "experienced an event that resulted in a loss of the stage." The company confirmed all personnel were safe and said ground teams followed "proper safety protocols."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/after-another-fiery-setback-it-seems-fireflys-alpha-rocket-is-still-in-beta/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5">released</a> Claude Sonnet 4.5, a new AI language model the company calls its "most capable model to date," with improved coding and computer use capabilities. The company also revealed <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code">Claude Code 2.0</a>, a command-line AI agent for developers, and the <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview">Claude Agent SDK</a>, which is a tool developers can use to build their own AI coding agents.</p>
<p>Anthropic says it has witnessed Sonnet 4.5 working continuously on the same project "for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks," though the company did not provide specific details about the tasks. In the past, agentic models have been known to typically lose coherence over long periods of time as errors accumulate and context windows (a type of short-term memory for the model) fill up. In the past, Anthropic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">has mentioned</a> that previous Claude 4.0 models have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">played <em>Pokémon</em></a> for over 24 hours or refactored code for seven hours.</p>
<p>To understand why Sonnet exists, you need to know a bit about how AI language models work. Traditionally, Anthropic has produced three differently sized AI models in the Claude family: Haiku (the smallest), Sonnet (mid-range), and Opus (the largest). Anthropic last updated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/anthropic-raises-eyebrows-with-haiku-price-hike-citing-increased-intelligence/">Haiku</a> in November 2024 (to 3.5), Sonnet this past <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">May</a> (to 4.0), and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1">Opus</a> in August (to 4.1). Model size in parameters, which are values stored in its neural network, is roughly proportional to overall contextual depth (the number of multidimensional connections between concepts, which you might call "knowledge") and better problem-solving capability, but larger models are also slower and more expensive to run. So AI companies always seek a sweet spot in the middle with reasonable performance-cost trade-offs. Claude Sonnet has filled that role for Anthropic quite well for several years now.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/anthropic-says-its-new-ai-model-maintained-focus-for-30-hours-on-multistep-tasks/">Read full article</a></p>

Analysts who spoke to Ars Technica said that the privately owned version of Electronic Arts will likely be very different from the old public company, in ways that could directly affect the kinds of games the mega-publisher produces.</p>
<h2>A $20 billion hole to fill</h2>
<p>One of the biggest differences between a publicly owned EA and a privately owned version is that the latter will be saddled with roughly $20 billion of fresh debt provided by JP MorganChase, which is being used to help finance the leveraged buyout. Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter estimates the firm will be on the hook for roughly $1 billion a year in service payments on that debt after the deal closes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/how-private-ownership-will-change-electronic-arts/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google plans to begin testing its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-will-block-sideloading-of-unverified-android-apps-starting-next-year/">recently announced verification scheme</a> for Android developers in the coming weeks, but there's still precious little information on how the process will work. F-Droid, the free and open source app repository, isn't waiting for the full rollout to take a position. In a blog post, F-Droid staff say that Google's plan to force devs outside Google Play to register with the company threatens to kill alternative app stores like F-Droid.</p>
<p>F-Droid has been around for about 15 years and is the largest source of free and open source software (FOSS) for Android. Because the apps in F-Droid are not installed via the Play Store, you have to sideload each APK manually, and Google is targeting that process in the name of security.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, Google announced plans to force all Android app developers to register their apps and identity with Google. Apps that have not been validated by the Big G will not be installable on any certified Android devices in the future. Since virtually every Android device outside of China runs Google services, that means Google is in control of the software we get to install on Android.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/f-droid-calls-for-regulators-to-stop-googles-crackdown-on-sideloading/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The European Space Agency signed a contract Monday with Avio, the Italian company behind the small Vega rocket, to begin designing a reusable upper stage capable of flying into orbit, returning to Earth, and launching again.</p>
<p>This is a feat more difficult than recovering and reusing a rocket's booster stage, something European industry has also yet to accomplish. SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket has a recoverable booster, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/after-a-very-slow-start-europes-reusable-rocket-program-shows-signs-of-life/">several companies in the United States, China, and Europe</a> are trying to replicate SpaceX's success with the partially reusable Falcon 9.</p>
<p>While other rocket companies try to catch up with the Falcon 9, SpaceX has turned its research and development dollars toward Starship, an enormous fully reusable rocket more than 400 feet (120 meters) tall. Even SpaceX, buttressed by the deep pockets of one of the world's richest persons, has had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/spacexs-lesson-from-last-starship-flight-we-need-to-seal-the-tiles/">trouble perfecting all the technologies</a> required to make Starship work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/esa-will-pay-an-italian-company-nearly-50-million-to-design-a-mini-starship/">Read full article</a></p>

Kelly flew two of his four missions aboard <em>Discovery</em>.</p>
<p>"Why should hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars be spent just to jeopardize a piece of American history that's already protected and on display?" wrote Kelly in a social media post on Friday. "Space Shuttle <em>Discovery</em> belongs at the Smithsonian, where millions of people, including students and veterans, go to see it for free."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/senators-to-appropriators-leave-space-shuttle-discovery-in-smithsonian/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Epic Games has disabled a <em>Fortnite</em> emote based on the HBO show <em>Peacemaker</em> after the latest episode cast the dancing animation in a potentially different light.</p>
<p><em>The remainder of this post contains spoilers for Season 2 of Peacemaker.</em></p>
<p>The "Peaceful Hips" emote, which was first introduced to the game on September 15, mirrors the dance motions that John Cena's character Christopher Smith makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS11-GIemXY">during the opening credits sequence</a> for the show's second season. In the dance and the emote (which can be applied to any character in-game), the dancer briefly flails their arms at opposing right angles before shaking their hips seductively.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/fortnite-disables-peacemaker-emote-that-might-resemble-a-swastika/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration is pressuring Taiwan to rapidly move 50 percent of its chip production into the US if it wants ensured protection against a threatened Chinese invasion, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPbY-YQAIOA">told NewsNation</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>In the interview, Lutnick noted that Taiwan currently makes about 95 percent of chips used in smartphones and cars, as well as in critical military defense technology. It's bad for the US, Lutnick said, that "95 percent of our chips are made 9,000 miles away," while China is not being "shy" about threats to "take" Taiwan.</p>
<p>Were the US to lose access to Taiwan's supply chain, the US could be defenseless as its economy takes a hit, Lutnick alleged, asking, "How are you going to get the chips here to make your drones, to make your equipment?"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/taiwan-pressured-to-move-50-of-chip-production-to-us-or-lose-protection/">Read full article</a></p>

Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners will join together to pay an estimated $55 billion for the video game mega-publisher in a deal being described as the "largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history."</p>
<p>EA stockholders will receive $210 per share in the deal, a 25 percent premium on the $168.32 price for a share at the close of business last Thursday (and well above the stock's $179 all-time-high share price). Share in EA closed at $193.35 on Friday after reports of the private sale first broke and are selling for roughly $203.50 per share in pre-market trading as of this writing.</p>
<p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who is expected to stay on after the deal is finalized in early 2027, said <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/exciting-news-about-our-future">in a public note to employees</a> that "this moment is a recognition of your creativity, your innovation, and your passion. You have built some of the world’s most iconic IP, created stories that have inspired global communities, and helped shape culture through interactive experiences. Everything we have achieved—and everything that lies ahead—is because of you."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/its-official-ea-is-selling-to-private-equity-in-55-billion-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Google DeepMind, Meta, and Nvidia are among the companies attempting to gain ground in the AI race by developing systems that aim to navigate the physical world by learning from videos and robotic data rather than just language.</p>
<p>This push comes as questions rise about whether large language models—the technology that powers popular chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT—are reaching a ceiling in their progress.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/big-ai-firms-pump-money-into-world-models-as-llm-advances-slow/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/nurburgring/">a racetrack with a funny name</a> in Germany that, in the eyes of many international enthusiasts, is the de facto benchmark for automotive performance. But the Nürburgring, a 13-mile (20 km) track often called the Green Hell, rarely hits the radar of mainstream US performance aficionados. That's because American car companies rarely take the time to run cars there, and if they do, it's in secrecy, to test pre-production machines cloaked in camouflage without publishing official times.</p>
<p>The track's domestic profile has lately been on the rise, though. Late last year, Ford became the first American manufacturer to run a sub-7-minute lap: 6:57.685 from its ultra-high-performance Mustang GTD. It then did better, announcing a 6:52.072 lap time in May. Two months later, Chevrolet set a 6:49.275 lap time with the hybrid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/the-first-corvette-hypercar-chevrolets-1250-hp-zr1x-hybrid-breaks-cover/">Corvette ZR1X</a>, becoming the new fastest American car around that track.</p>
<p>It's a vehicular war of escalation, but it's about much more than bragging rights.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/zr1-gtd-and-americas-new-nurburgring-war/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>I love 4X games. I've tried other strategy game genres, but frankly, they don't stick if they're not first and foremost 4X games—at the heart of it, it must be about exploring, expanding, exploiting, and yes, exterminating.</p>
<p>I suspect that the first 4X game most people played was some entry in the Civilization franchise—though certainly, a select few played precursors dating back to text-based games in the 1970s.</p>
<p>But for me, the title that kicked off my obsession was <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fmaster_of_orion_1_2"><em>Master of Orion II</em></a> (<em>MOO2</em>)—a game that has you develop and build up planets across a simple galaxy map, researching speculative future technologies and ultimately wiping out your opponents and claiming dominion over the known universe. (There are other victory conditions, too, but that one is the most fun.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/30-years-later-im-still-obliterating-planets-in-master-of-orion-ii-and-you-can-too/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One hundred and fifty million years ago, the <a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/mesozoic/jurassic/solnhofen.html">Solnhofen Limestones</a> of Germany were covered in small islands and warm saltwater lagoons. Coral reefs flourished with crinoids, sponges, <a href="https://www.thefossilforum.com/gallery/image/21442-rhizostomites-admirandus-h%C3%A4ckel-1866/">jellyfish,</a> and <a href="https://www.thefossilforum.com/gallery/image/4490-cycleryon-propinquus-positive_upper-jurassic_europejpg/">crustaceans</a>; <a href="https://rumblemuseum.org.uk/index.php/collections/departmental/37-science-department-collection/51-protolindenia-wittei-dragonfly">Dragonflies</a> buzzed above the water as small <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/adorable-alligatorellus">reptiles</a> sunned themselves at the water’s edge. Pterosaurs and <i>Archaeopteryx </i>took to the skies, but there was trouble in this Jurassic paradise: Tropical storms would turn it into a pterosaur graveyard.</p>
<p>What paleontologist Rab Smyth found in this graveyard finally revealed why so many fledgling pterosaurs had succumbed to the storm. Smyth, a researcher at the Center for Paleobiology and Biosphere Evolution at the University of Leicester, unearthed two <a href="https://www.collections.grisda.org/browse-solnhofen-lagerstatte/pterodactylus-antiquus"><i>Pterodactylus antiquus</i></a> hatchlings, and their bones showed exactly how they had succumbed to storm winds. The wings of both specimens (ironically named Lucky I and Lucky II) revealed clean, slanted humerus fractures that suggested they had been twisted in the storm. Unable to fly, they drowned and were rapidly buried in the lagoon depths.</p>
<p>“Our results show that most pterosaurs are preserved predominantly through catastrophic events, often reflecting mass mortality episodes,” Smyth and his research team said in a study he led, recently published in Current Biology.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/150-million-year-old-pterosaur-cold-case-has-finally-been-solved/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Late last week, The Hollywood Reporter <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/stan-lee-ai-hologram-l-a-comic-con-1236375354/">ran a story</a> about an "AI Stan Lee hologram" that would be appearing at <a href="https://www.comicconla.com/">the LA Comic Con this weekend</a>. Nearly seven years after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/legendary-marvel-comics-creator-stan-lee-has-died/">the famous Marvel Comics creator’s death at the age of 95</a>, fans will be able to pay $15 to $20 this weekend to chat with a life-sized, AI-powered avatar of Lee in an enclosed booth at the show.</p>
<p>The instant response from many fans and media outlets to the idea was not kind, to say the least. A writer for TheGamer <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/stan-lee-la-comic-con-hologram-ai-evil/">called the very idea "demonic"</a> and said we need to "kill it with fire before it’s too late." The AV Club <a href="https://www.avclub.com/stan-lee-ai-hologram-comic-con">urged its readers</a> not to pay to see "the anguished digital ghost of a beloved comic book creator, repurposed as a trap for chumps!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/1nmsk3g/removed_by_moderator/">Reactions on a popular Reddit thread</a> ranged from calling it "incredibly disrespectful" and "in bad taste" to "ghoulish" and "so fucked up," with very little that was more receptive to the concept.</p>
<p>But Chris DeMoulin, the CEO of the parent company behind LA Comic Con, urged critics to come see the AI-powered hologram for themselves before rushing to judgment. "We're not afraid of people seeing it and we're not afraid of criticism," he told Ars. "I’m just a fan of informed criticism, and I think most of what's been out there so far has not really been informed."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/why-la-comic-con-thought-making-an-ai-powered-stan-lee-hologram-was-a-good-idea/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You can't spot a hedgehog from space, but you might be able to find where they live by looking for brambles. That's the premise behind <a href="https://toao.com/blog/can-we-really-see-brambles-from-space">ongoing research</a> at the University of Cambridge, where scientists are using satellite imagery and AI models to map potential hedgehog habitats across the UK by first identifying their favorite hiding spots: bramble patches.</p>
<p>European hedgehog populations have <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2022/february/britains-rural-hedgehogs-see-dramatic-population-decline.html">declined</a> by roughly 30 to 50 percent over the past decade, so tracking these nocturnal creatures across large areas remains difficult and expensive. Rather than searching for the hedgehogs directly, researcher Gabriel Mahler developed an AI model that identifies brambles, which are thorny shrubs that hedgehogs use for shelter and foraging, from satellite data.</p>
<p>These small mammals rely on this type of dense vegetation for daytime shelter, nesting sites, and protection from predators. Brambles also attract insects and provide berries, supporting the invertebrate populations that hedgehogs eat.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/can-ai-detect-hedgehogs-from-space-maybe-if-you-find-brambles-first/">Read full article</a></p>

The woman had Type 2 diabetes, Stage 2 chronic kidney disease, opioid use disorder, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), among other conditions.

<p>On Thursday, LG announced the Easy TV in South Korea, aiming it at the “senior TV market,” according to a Google translation of the <a href="https://live.lge.co.kr/2509-lg-easytv/">press release</a>. One of the features that LG has included in attempts to appeal to this demographic is a remote control with numbers. Many remotes for smart TVs, streaming sticks, and boxes don’t have numbered buttons, with much of the controller's real estate dedicated to other inputs.</p>
