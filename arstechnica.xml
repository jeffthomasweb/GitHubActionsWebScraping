<p>This is the rocket that literally lights itself on fire before it heads to space. It's the world's largest rocket entirely fueled by liquid hydrogen, a propellant that is vexing to handle but rewarding in its efficiency.</p>
<p>The Delta IV Heavy was America's most powerful launch vehicle for nearly a decade and has been a cornerstone for the US military's space program for more than 20 years. It is also the world's most expensive commercially produced rocket, a fact driven not just by its outsized capability but also its complexity.</p>
<p>Now, United Launch Alliance's last Delta IV Heavy rocket is set to lift off Thursday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, with a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government's spy satellite agency.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012923#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012923&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thousands of servers storing AI workloads and network credentials have been hacked in an ongoing attack campaign targeting a reported vulnerability in Ray, a computing framework used by OpenAI, Uber, and Amazon.</p>
<p>The attacks, which have been active for at least seven months, have led to the tampering of AI models. They have also resulted in the compromise of network credentials, allowing access to internal networks and databases and tokens for accessing accounts on platforms including OpenAI, Hugging Face, Stripe, and Azure. Besides corrupting models and stealing credentials, attackers behind the campaign have installed cryptocurrency miners on compromised infrastructure, which typically provides massive amounts of computing power. Attackers have also installed reverse shells, which are text-based interfaces for remotely controlling servers.</p>
<h2>Hitting the jackpot</h2>
<p>“When attackers get their hands on a Ray production cluster, it is a jackpot,” researchers from Oligo, the security firm that spotted the attacks, wrote in a <a href="https://www.oligo.security/blog/shadowray-attack-ai-workloads-actively-exploited-in-the-wild">post</a>. “Valuable company data plus remote code execution makes it easy to monetize attacks—all while remaining in the shadows, totally undetected (and, with static security tools, undetectable).”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013046#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013046&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>There's a strong consensus that tackling most useful problems with a quantum computer will require that the computer be capable of error correction. There is absolutely no consensus, however, about what technology will allow us to get there. A large number of companies, including major players like Microsoft, Intel, Amazon, and IBM, have all committed to different technologies to get there, while a collection of startups are exploring an even wider range of potential solutions.</p>
<p>We probably won't have a clearer picture of what's likely to work for a few years. But there's going to be lots of interesting research and development work between now and then, some of which may ultimately represent key milestones in the development of quantum computing. To give you a sense of that work, we're going to look at three papers that were published within the last couple of weeks, each of which tackles a different aspect of quantum computing technology.</p>
<h2>Hot stuff</h2>
<p>Error correction will require connecting multiple hardware qubits to act as a single unit termed a logical qubit. This spreads a single bit of quantum information across multiple hardware qubits, making it more robust. Additional qubits are used to monitor the behavior of the ones holding the data and perform corrections as needed. Some error correction schemes require over a hundred hardware qubits for each logical qubit, meaning we'd need tens of thousands of hardware qubits before we could do anything practical.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013053#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013053&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Puerto Rico has declared a public health emergency amid an ongoing outbreak of dengue infections, a mosquito-spread viral infection that can cause fever, aches, rash, vomiting, and, in about 5 percent of cases, a severe disease marked by internal bleeding and shock.</p>
<p>The US territory has tallied 549 cases since the start of the year, representing a <a href="https://www.salud.pr.gov/CMS/DOWNLOAD/8768">140 percent increase</a> compared with cases tallied at this point last year, <a href="https://www.salud.pr.gov/menuInst/download/1833">according to the territory's health department</a>. The Associated Press reported that more than 340 of the 549 cases have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>In 2023, the island nation of more than 3.2 million people had over 1,000 cases of dengue throughout the year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013036#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013036&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Starlink's mobile ambitions were dealt at least a temporary blow yesterday when the Federal Communications Commission dismissed SpaceX's application to use several spectrum bands for mobile service.</p>
<p>SpaceX is seeking approval to use up to 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites with spectrum in the 1.6 GHz, 2 GHz, and 2.4 GHz bands. SpaceX could still end up getting what it wants but will have to go through new rulemaking processes in which the FCC will evaluate whether the spectrum bands can handle the system without affecting existing users.</p>
<p>The FCC Space Bureau's <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/spacex-gen2-mss-application-dismissed-unacceptable-filing">ruling</a> dismissed the SpaceX application yesterday as "unacceptable for filing."

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Physicists have been confident since the1980s that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, similar to those thought to be at the center of most spiral and elliptical galaxies. It's since been dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sagittarius A*</a> (pronounced A-star), or SgrA* for short. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured the first image of SgrA* two years ago. Now the collaboration has revealed a new polarized image (above) showcasing the black hole's swirling magnetic fields. The technical details appear in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ad2df0">two</a> new <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad2df1">papers</a> published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The new image is strikingly similar to another EHT image of a larger supermassive black hole, M87*, so this might be something that all such black holes share.</p>
<p>The only way to "see" a black hole is to image the shadow created by light as it bends in response to the object's powerful gravitational field. As Ars Science Editor <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/event-horizon-telescope-gives-us-first-images-of-what-its-named-for/" data-uri="2739cb45160166b5cc4167c3ef232c6d">John Timmer reported in 2019,</a> the EHT isn't a telescope in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a collection of telescopes scattered around the globe. The EHT is created by interferometry, which uses light in the microwave regime of the electromagnetic spectrum captured at different locations. These recorded images are combined and processed to build an image with a resolution similar to that of a telescope the size of the most distant locations. Interferometry has been used at facilities like ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) in northern Chile, where telescopes can be spread across 16 km of desert.</p>
<p>In theory, there's no upper limit on the size of the array, but to determine which photons originated simultaneously at the source, you need very precise location and timing information on each of the sites. And you still have to gather sufficient photons to see anything at all. So atomic clocks were installed at many of the locations, and exact GPS measurements were built up over time. For the EHT, the large collecting area of ALMA—combined with choosing a wavelength in which supermassive black holes are very bright—ensured sufficient photons.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012771#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012771&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Unsealed court documents have revealed more details about a secret Facebook project initially called "Ghostbusters," designed to sneakily access encrypted Snapchat usage data to give Facebook a leg up on its rival, just when Snapchat was experiencing rapid growth in 2016.</p>
<p>The documents were filed in a class-action lawsuit from consumers and advertisers, accusing Meta of anticompetitive behavior that blocks rivals from competing in the social media ads market.</p>
<p>"Whenever someone asks a question about Snapchat, the answer is usually that because their traffic is encrypted, we have no analytics about them," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (who has since rebranded his company as Meta) <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.369872/gov.uscourts.cand.369872.736.0.pdf">wrote</a> in a 2016 email to Javier Olivan.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012980#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012980&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Online graphic design platform provider Canva announced its acquisition of Affinity on Tuesday. The purchase adds tools for creative professionals to the Australian startup's repertoire, presenting competition for today's digital design stronghold, Adobe.</p>
<p>The companies didn't provide specifics about the deal, but Cliff Obrecht, Canva's co-founder and COO, told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/canva-acquires-affinity-design-suite-in-push-to-rival-adobe">Bloomberg</a> that it consists of cash and stock and is worth "several hundred million pounds."</p>
<p>Canva, which debuted in 2013, has made numerous acquisitions to date, including Flourish, Kaleido, and Pixabay, but its purchase of Affinity is its biggest yet—by both price and headcount (90). Affinity CEO Ashley Hewson said via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcaGgGErLMo">YouTube video</a> that Canva approached Affinity about a potential deal two months ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012895#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012895&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ai-comes-for-your-pcs-keyboard-as-microsoft-adds-dedicated-copilot-key/">said in January</a> that 2024 would be the year of the "AI PC," and we know that AI PCs will include a few hardware components that most Windows systems currently do not include—namely, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/02/your-current-pc-probably-doesnt-have-an-ai-processor-but-your-next-one-might/">a built-in neural processing unit</a> (NPU) and Microsoft's new Copilot key for keyboards. But so far we haven't heard a whole lot about what a so-called AI PC will actually do for users.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Intel are starting to talk about a few details as part of an announcement from Intel about a new AI PC developer program that will encourage software developers to leverage local hardware to build AI features into their apps.</p>
<p>The main news <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-confirms-microsoft-copilot-will-soon-run-locally-on-pcs-next-gen-ai-pcs-require-40-tops-of-npu-performance">comes from Tom's Hardware</a>, confirming that AI PCs would be able to run "more elements of Copilot," Microsoft's AI chatbot assistant, "locally on the client." Currently, Copilot relies on server-side processing even for small requests, introducing lag that is tolerable if you're making a broad request for information but less so if all you want to do is change a setting or get basic answers. Running generative AI models locally could also improve user privacy, making it possible to take advantage of AI-infused software without automatically sending information to a company that will use it for further model training.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012793#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012793&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When renders of the Pixel 9 came out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/googles-pixel-9-gets-its-first-leaked-render-looks-a-lot-like-an-iphone/">in January</a> from OnLeaks, we got our first hints that a big change in Google's lineup was afoot. Usually, the company does a big "Pro" phone with three cameras and all the premium features and then a smaller Pixel that gets cut down somewhat, usually with only two cameras. Those January renders showed a big and small phone <em>both</em> with three cameras, indicating the base model Pixel 9 was getting updated to be a "mini-Pro" model—a smaller phone, but still with all the trimmings. The small Pro model still seems to be in the works, but apparently, that's not the base model.</p>
<p>The new render from <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-renders-design-exclusive/">OnLeaks and 91Mobiles</a> shows a <em>third</em> Pixel 9. This one is the usual cut-down small model with only two cameras. Apparently, the lineup would now be a 6.8-inch "Pixel 9 Pro XL," a "Pixel 9 Pro" at 6.1 inches, and a "Pixel 9" at 6.0 inches.</p>
<p>The base model's design looks just like the other Pixel 9 leaks. The camera bar takes on a new rounded pill shape. The sides switch to a flat metal band, like an iPhone 4/15. The corners of the display and phone body are much more rounded.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012841#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012841&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Venus Aerospace conducted its first powered flight last month, reaching Mach 0.9 with a drone.</p>
<p>The 8-foot-long vehicle was dropped from an Aero L-29 Delfín aircraft at 12,000 feet and flew under the power of a hydrogen peroxide monopropellant engine. This engine was not fired at full thrust because the location of the test flight, an unspecified range in the United States, did not permit flight faster than the speed of sound, said Andrew Duggleby, co-founder and chief technology officer of the Houston-based company.</p>
<p>This first powered flight came as the company announced a long-duration test firing of its rotating detonation rocket engine, an experimental approach to propulsion that could be about 15 percent more efficient than a conventional chemical rocket engine. The company's long-term ambition is to develop a commercial aircraft that can travel at Mach 9—far faster than any previous airplane. That's clearly a ways off, but these are important, if early, steps on that path.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012893#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012893&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Human weaknesses are a rich target for phishing attacks. Making humans click "Don't Allow" over and over again in a phone prompt that can't be skipped is an angle some iCloud attackers are taking—and likely having some success.</p>
<p>Brian Krebs' at Krebs on Security <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/recent-mfa-bombing-attacks-targeting-apple-users/">detailed the attacks in a recent post</a>, noting that "MFA Fatigue Attacks" are a <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/mfa-fatigue-attack">known attack strategy</a>. By repeatedly hitting a potential victim's device with multifactor authentication requests, the attack fills a device's screen with prompts that typically have yes/no options, often very close together. Apple's devices are just the latest rich target for this technique.</p>
<p>Both the Kremlin-backed Fancy Bear advanced persistent threat group and a rag-tag bunch of teenagers known as Lapsus$ have been known to use the technique, also known as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/lapsus-and-solar-winds-hackers-both-use-the-same-old-trick-to-bypass-mfa/">MFA prompt bombing</a>, successfully.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012822#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012822&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Just shy of half past 1 in the morning, the MV <em>Dali</em>, a giant container ship, was sailing gently out of the port of Baltimore when something went terribly wrong. Suddenly, lights all over the 300-meter-long vessel went out. They flicked on again a moment later, but the ship then began to veer to the right, toward one of the massive pylon-like supports on the Francis Scott Key truss bridge—a huge mass of steel and concrete that spans the Patapsco River.</p>
<p>The <em>Dali</em>’s lights went out a second time. Then the impact came. The ship plowed into the support, with large sections of the bridge’s main truss section instantly snapping apart and falling into the river. It took just 20 seconds or so for the structure to come down.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>NEW YORK—On Wednesday, Polestar formally launched its next electric vehicle in the North American market at the New York International Auto Show. Until now, Polestar's range has been a little limited—there was the Polestar 1, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/the-polestar-1-is-a-turbocharged-supercharged-plug-in-hybrid-enigma/">a handsome if a little eccentric plug-in hybrid GT</a> that went out of production after just 1,500 examples. And there's the Polestar 2 sedan, now available as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/now-rear-wheel-drive-the-single-motor-polestar-2-is-better-than-ever/">a more efficient, more fun rear-wheel drive variant</a>. But the brand has lacked that most popular of body styles, the SUV—until now.</p>
<p>"We have been obviously waiting for this year so much in order to really accelerate now. So the two cars coming are SUVs, [which] is, for us, key to really get into the dimension that we want to be," said Thomas Ingenlath, CEO of Polestar. "We have invested so much into the brand. We have so much invested into being in 25 countries. Of course we need now that kind of scale, a minimum of a three-car company to justify all of that," he said.</p>
<p>The latest addition is called the Polestar 4, which slightly confusingly slots between the smaller Polestar 2 sedan and larger, more expensive Polestar 3—the other SUV <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/polestar-announces-polestar-3-pricing-electric-suv-starts-at-73400/">that joins the range this year</a>. It has a clear family resemblance to its siblings, with similar front styling to the Polestar 3 and a fastback rear that calls back to the Polestar 2. The decision to ditch the rear windshield will no doubt be controversial—instead, the Polestar 4 uses a camera-based mirror that provides a wider-angle view of things behind the car than a normal passive mirror.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012902#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012902&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, Anthropic's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">Claude 3 Opus</a> large language model (LLM) surpassed OpenAI's GPT-4 (which powers ChatGPT) for the first time on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/turing-test-on-steroids-chatbot-arena-crowdsources-ratings-for-45-ai-models/">Chatbot Arena</a>, a popular crowdsourced <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">leaderboard</a> used by AI researchers to gauge the relative capabilities of AI language models. "The king is dead," <a href="https://x.com/NickADobos/status/1772764680639148285?s=20">tweeted</a> software developer Nick Dobos in a post comparing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">GPT-4 Turbo</a> and Claude 3 Opus that has been making the rounds on social media. "RIP GPT-4."</p>

<p>Since GPT-4 was included in Chatbot Arena <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-10-leaderboard/">around May 10, 2023</a> (the leaderboard launched <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/">May 3</a> of that year), variations of GPT-4 have consistently been on the top of the chart until now, so its defeat in the Arena is a notable moment in the relatively short history of AI language models. One of Anthropic's smaller models, Haiku, has also been turning heads with its performance on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>"For the first time, the best available models—Opus for advanced tasks, Haiku for cost and efficiency—are from a vendor that isn't OpenAI," independent AI researcher Simon Willison told Ars Technica. "That's reassuring—we all benefit from a diversity of top vendors in this space. But GPT-4 is over a year old at this point, and it took that year for anyone else to catch up."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012778#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012778&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since the days of the NES, the one unshakable distinction between the PC and console gaming markets was the latter's "walled garden" approach to game distribution. For decades now, console makers have completely controlled the licensing and sales methods available for games on their own hardware.</p>
<p>So when Microsoft Xbox chief Phil Spencer says that he's open to breaking down that walled garden for his consoles, it's a big deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108670/xbox-epic-games-store-phil-spencer-interview">Speaking to Polygon</a> in an interview at last week's Game Developers Conference, Spencer said he could foresee a future in which competing game marketplaces like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/epic-opens-up-its-games-store-to-everyone-with-self-publishing-tools/">the Epic Games Store</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/today-only-itch-io-waives-devs-fees-for-your-drm-free-game-purchases/">indie clearinghouse itch.io</a> were available directly on Xbox hardware. “[Consider] our history as the Windows company," Spencer told Polygon. "Nobody would blink twice if I said, 'Hey, when you’re using a PC, you get to decide the type of experience you have [by picking where to buy games].' There’s real value in that."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012805#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012805&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This week, Florida made headlines after passing HB 3, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/florida-braces-for-lawsuits-over-law-banning-kids-from-social-media/">a law banning children under 14 from accessing social media</a> without parental consent.</p>
<p>Much less attention was given to another requirement under the law obligating "pornographic or sexually explicit websites" to "use age verification to prevent minors from accessing sites that are inappropriate for children," as Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis explained the law in a <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/25/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-protect-children-and-uphold-parental-rights/">statement</a>.</p>
<p>But Pornhub's parent company, Aylo, has taken notice, with a spokesperson confirming to Ars that "we are aware of the passage into law of HB 3 in Florida, which unfortunately fails to protect minors online."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012788#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012788&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Your keyboard is the thread that connects you to your computer. The way a keyboard feels—from the sensations of each key pressing down and resetting to the build of the board’s chassis—has a direct impact on your typing experience, affecting accuracy, speed, and fatigue.</p>
<p>We’ve dug into the joys of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/the-best-wireless-mechanical-keyboards/">quality keyboards</a> and the thrills of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/typing-my-way-down-the-mechanical-keyboard-rabbit-hole-with-the-drop-ctrl/">customization</a> at Ars Technica before. But what really makes one type of keyboard feel better than another? People say membrane keyboards feel mushy, but <em>why</em>? And what about keyboards with cult-like followings? What makes decades-old IBM keyboards or expensive Topres so special?</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll look at how some of the most popular keyboard categories work and how their differences impact typing feel.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007717#p3">Read 51 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007717&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Wild migratory birds likely spread a deadly strain of bird flu to dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, <a href="https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/2024/2024-03-26_HPAI_Dairies.pdf">state</a> and <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/news/sa_by_date/sa-2024/hpai-cattle">federal officials</a> announced this week.</p>
<p>It is believed to be the first time the virus, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), has been found in cows in the US. Last week, officials in Minnesota confirmed finding an HPAI case <a href="https://www.avma.org/news/goat-minnesota-tests-positive-hpai">in a young goat</a>, marking the first time the virus has been found in a domestic ruminant in the US.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-dairy-cattle-usda-kansas-texas-c3040bb31a9a8293717d47362f006902">According to the Associated Press</a>, officials with the Texas Animal Health Commission confirmed the flu virus is the Type A H5N1 strain, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/as-egg-prices-soar-the-bloodiest-bird-flu-outbreak-in-us-history-drags-on/">ravaging bird populations around the globe for several years</a>.
