              <![CDATA[<p>Ralph Loya was pretty sure he was going to lose the corn. His farm had been scorched by El Paso’s hottest-ever June and second-hottest August; the West Texas county saw 53 days soar over 100° Fahrenheit in the summer of 2024. The region was also experiencing an ongoing drought, which meant that crops on Loya’s eight-plus acres of melons, okra, cucumbers, and other produce had to be watered more often than normal.</p>
<p>Loya had been irrigating his corn with somewhat salty, or brackish, water pumped from his well, as much as the salt-sensitive crop could tolerate. It wasn’t enough, and the municipal water was expensive; he was using it in moderation, and the corn ears were desiccating where they stood.</p>
<p>Ensuring the survival of agriculture under an increasingly erratic climate is approaching a <a href="https://www.doi.gov/priorities/addressing-the-drought-crisis">crisis</a> in the sere and sweltering Western and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/texas-running-out-water-sid-miller-1952025">Southwestern</a> United States, an area that supplies much of our beef and dairy, alfalfa, tree nuts, and produce. Contending with <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/new-afbf-survey-shows-droughts-increasing-toll-on-farmers-and-ranchers">too little water</a> to support their plants and animals, farmers have tilled under crops, pulled out trees, fallowed fields, and sold off herds. They’ve also used drip irrigation to inject <a href="https://www.globalagtechinitiative.com/in-field-technologies/irrigation/ag-tech-providing-solutions-to-drought-impacted-farms/">smaller doses of water closer to a plant’s roots and installed sensors</a> in soil that tell more precisely when and how much to water.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/can-desalination-quench-agricultures-thirst/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A Delaware judge today rejected Elon Musk's bid to reinstate a Tesla pay package that was worth over $50 billion at the beginning of 2024 and has now crossed $100 billion based on Tesla's latest share price. The judge also ordered Tesla to pay $345 million in attorneys' fees to the plaintiff's counsel, who had sought $5.6 billion in fees.</p>
<p>Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/">voided the pay plan in January</a>, said today that a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/musk-says-hes-winning-tesla-shareholder-vote-on-pay-plan-by-wide-margin/">June 2024 shareholder vote</a> re-approving the 2018 pay plan is not a compelling reason to reverse the original ruling. Her <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=372420">ruling</a> said that a "large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law."</p>
<p>Musk is thus prevented from accessing a pay package whose potential value has soared along with Tesla's stock price. "As of Monday, the pay package was worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/delaware-judge-rejects-request-restore-elon-musks-56-billion-tesla-compensation-2024-12-02/">Reuters wrote</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/judge-again-rejects-the-elon-musk-tesla-pay-plan-now-valued-at-101-billion/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I hope everyone survived the weekend shopping experience and no one was eaten by ravening bands of deal-hunting nomads as they trekked through Macy's, or whatever people who actually go outside on Black Friday have to endure. Things are mostly quiet here at the Ars Orbiting HQ—the gift shop on the mess deck is still selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/store/">mugs and other merch</a>, if anyone wants some Ars stuff!—but the e-commerce communications panel is beeping and it says we've got more deals to show you guys for Cyber Monday!</p>
<p>Cyber Monday is the thing that happens <em>after</em> Black Friday, where the deals keep going past the weekend and erupt into the next week, like some kind of out-of-control roller coaster of capitalism careening off the rails and into the crowd. Headphones! Power stations! Tablets! More board games! We've got so many things for you to buy!</p>
<p>A couple of quick notes: First, we're going to continue updating this list throughout Monday as things change, so if you don't see anything that tickles your fancy right now, check back in a few hours! Additionally, although we're making every effort to keep our prices accurate, deals are constantly shifting around, and an item's actual price might have drifted from what we list. <em>Caveat emptor</em> and all that.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2024/12/its-black-friday-and-here-are-the-best-shopping-deals-we-could-find/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> is more than just an AI language model with a fancy interface. It's a system consisting of a stack of AI models and content filters that make sure its outputs don't embarrass OpenAI or get the company into legal trouble when its bot occasionally <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">makes up potentially harmful facts</a> about people.</p>
<p>Recently, that reality made the news when <a href="https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1862910201113739328">people discovered</a> that the name "David Mayer" breaks ChatGPT. 404 Media also <a href="https://www.404media.co/not-just-david-mayer-chatgpt-breaks-when-asked-about-two-law-professors/">discovered</a> that the names "Jonathan Zittrain" and "Jonathan Turley" caused ChatGPT to cut conversations short. And we know another name, likely the first, that started the practice last year: Brian Hood. More on that below.</p>
<p>The chat-breaking behavior occurs consistently when users mention these names in any context, and it results from a hard-coded filter that puts the brakes on the AI model's output before returning it to the user.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/certain-names-make-chatgpt-grind-to-a-halt-and-we-know-why/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Some of the most bizarre lifeforms on Earth lurk in the deeper realms of the ocean. There was so little known about one of these creatures that it took 20 years just to figure out what exactly it was. Things only got weirder from there.</p>
<p>The organism’s distinctive, glowing presence was observed by multiple deep-sea missions between 2000 to 2021 but was simply referred to as “mystery mollusk.” A team of Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) researchers has now reviewed extensive footage of past mystery mollusk sightings and used MBARI’s remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to observe it and collect samples. They’ve given it a name and have finally confirmed that it is a nudibranch—the first and only nudibranch known to live at such depths.</p>
<p><i>Bathydevius caudactylus, </i>as this nudibranch is now called, lives 1,000–4,000 meters (3,300–13,100 feet) deep in the ocean’s bathypelagic or midnight zone. It moves like a jellyfish, eats like a Venus flytrap, and is bioluminescent, and its genes are distinct enough for it to be classified as the first member of a new phylogenetic family.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/glowing-sea-slug-behaves-like-a-jellyfish-lizard-and-venus-flytrap/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Rob Bauer, the chair of a NATO military committee, reportedly said, “It is more competent not to wait, but to hit launchers in Russia in case Russia attacks us. We must strike first.” These comments, supposedly made in 2024, were later interpreted as suggesting NATO should attempt a <a href="https://londonlovesbusiness.com/nato-military-chief-warns-we-must-strike-first-in-a-preemptive-attack-against-russia/">preemptive strike</a> against Russia, an idea that lots of people found outrageously dangerous.</p>
<p>But lots of people also missed a thing about the quote: Bauer has never said it. It was made up. Despite that, the purported statement got nearly 250,000 views on X and was mindlessly spread further by the likes of <a href="https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/1861562179024998543">Alex Jones</a>.</p>
<p>Why do stories like this get so many views and shares? “The vast majority of misinformation studies assume people want to be accurate, but certain things distract them,” says William J. Brady, a researcher at Northwestern University. “Maybe it’s the social media environment. Maybe they’re not understanding the news, or the sources are confusing them. But what we found is that when content evokes outrage, people are consistently sharing it without even clicking into the article.” Brady co-authored a study on how misinformation exploits outrage to spread online. When we get outraged, the study suggests, we simply care way less if what’s got us outraged is even real.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/people-will-share-misinformation-that-sparks-moral-outrage/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Musk says for-profit OpenAI harms public interest—and his own company, xAI.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Friday filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.433688/gov.uscourts.cand.433688.46.0.pdf">motion</a> for preliminary injunction asking a federal court to block OpenAI's planned conversion from a nonprofit to for-profit entity.</p>
<p>The motion in US District Court for the Northern District of California is the latest major filing in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.433688/gov.uscourts.cand.433688.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/openai-wouldnt-exist-without-me-elon-musk-says-reviving-lawsuit/">initiated against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman</a> in August. "There can be no serious question that OpenAI's imminent conversion to a for-profit entity violates the terms of Musk's donations," the motion said, referring to $44 million that Musk says he contributed to OpenAI from 2016 to 2020.</p>
<p>Musk's motion makes it clear he is worried that a for-profit OpenAI would spell trouble for his own company, xAI. Musk alleged on Friday that OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, are "together exploiting Musk's donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI," and that "OpenAI's path from a non-profit to for-profit behemoth is replete with <em>per se</em> anticompetitive practices, flagrant breaches of its charitable mission, and rampant self-dealing."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/elon-musk-asks-court-to-block-openai-conversion-from-nonprofit-to-for-profit/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's final move to stop China from racing ahead of the US in AI may be too little too late, reports say.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Biden administration announced new export controls, perhaps most notably restricting exports to China of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI applications. According <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/latest-us-strike-chinas-chips-hits-semiconductor-toolmakers-2024-12-02/">to Reuters</a>, additional export curbs are designed to also impede China from accessing "24 additional chipmaking tools and three software tools," as well as "chipmaking equipment made in countries such as Singapore and Malaysia."</p>
<p>Nearly two dozen Chinese semiconductor companies will be added to the US entity list restricting their access to US technology, Reuters reported, alongside more than 100 chipmaking toolmakers and two investment companies. These include many companies that Huawei Technologies—one of the biggest targets of US export controls for years—depends on.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/bidens-last-jab-at-china-curbs-on-memory-chips-chipmakers-investors/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>China's new Long March 12 rocket made a successful inaugural flight Saturday, placing two experimental satellites into orbit and testing uprated, higher-thrust engines that will allow a larger Chinese launcher in development to send astronauts to the Moon.</p>
<p>The 203-foot-tall (62-meter) Long March 12 rocket lifted off at 9:25 am EST (14:25 UTC) Saturday from the Wenchang commercial launch site on Hainan Island, China's southernmost province. This was also the first rocket launch from a new commercial spaceport at Wenchang, consisting of two launch sites a short distance from a pair of existing launch pads used by heavier rockets primarily geared for government missions.</p>
<p>The two-stage rocket delivered two technology demonstration satellites into a near-circular 50-degree-inclination orbit with an average altitude of nearly 650 miles (about 1,040 kilometers), according to US military tracking data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/you-can-add-another-new-rocket-to-chinas-growing-stable-of-launch-vehicles/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Companies have been discussing migrating off of VMware since Broadcom’s takeover a year ago led to higher costs and other <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/price-hikes-of-over-2x-widely-expected-under-broadcoms-vmware-survey-finds/">controversial changes</a>. Now we have an inside look at one of the larger customers that recently made the move.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/">The Register</a> today, Beeks Group, a cloud operator headquartered in the United Kingdom, has moved most of its 20,000-plus virtual machines (VMs) off VMware and to OpenNebula, an open source cloud and edge computing platform. Beeks Group sells virtual private servers and bare metal servers to financial service providers. It still has some VMware VMs, but “the majority” of its machines are currently on OpenNebula, The Register reported.</p>
<p>Beeks’ head of production management, Matthew Cretney, said that one of the reasons for Beeks' migration was a VMware bill for “10 times the sum it previously paid for software licenses,” per The Register.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When an updated, remastered, or otherwise spiffed-up version of a game is released, nobody—not long-time fans, not archivists, not anybody, really—ever asks for the original version of that game to be taken down. Does this seem to stop game studios from committing this unforced public relations error? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Blizzard, a company that has recently released <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/warcraft-rts">remastered versions of <em>Warcraft </em>and </a><em><a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/warcraft-rts">Warcraft II</a></em> for $10 and $15, respectively (or in a bundle with <em>III</em> for $40) on its Battle.net storefront, has asked GOG to remove its non-remastered, DRM-free <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww">$15 bundle of those games</a> from its store on December 13.</p>
<p>GOG (aka Good Old Games), which recently included <em>Warcraft I </em>and <em>II</em> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/gogs-preservation-program-is-the-drm-free-store-refocusing-on-the-classics/">its Preservation Program</a>, with a "Make Games Live Forever" tagline, suddenly finds itself with a new policy to figure out. So GOG is putting the <em>Warcraft I &amp; II Bundle</em> on sale (discount code "MakeWarcraftLiveForever" for $2 off) and is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/warcraft_12_will_be_delisted_from_gogwhat_does_this_mean_in_regard_to_the_gog_preservation_program">letting folks know</a> that if they buy it before December 13, they will keep access to it after the delisting, complete with offline installers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/blizzards-pulling-of-warcraft-i-ii-tests-gogs-new-preservation-program/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Volkswagen workers in Germany have gone on strike today in the largest industrial action taken against the company since 2018. The union IG Metall, which represents about 120,000 VW workers, voted to approve the strike on November 22, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-workers-go-out-warning-strikes-across-germany-2024-12-01/">describing the situation</a> as "the toughest collective bargaining battle Volkswagen has ever seen."</p>
<p>IG Metall's members are striking in response to VW's plans to cut its European manufacturing costs, which are dragging on the company at the same time as the Chinese market <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/volkswagen-china.html">has become more difficult</a> due to domestic competition, as well as a softening of global demand for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>VW's response to these tough times has been to propose a 10 percent pay cut, thousands of layoffs, and the closure of three German factories—the first time such a thing will have happened in the company's 87-year history.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/volkswagen-workers-go-on-strike-as-union-fights-factory-closures/">Read full article</a></p>

      Sony Picture's <em>Kraven the Hunter</em> explores origins of titular villain.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Hollywood is coming off a record-breaking Thanksgiving weekend, thanks to the winning trifecta of <em>Moana 2</em>,<em> Gladiator II,</em> and <em>Wicked Part 1</em>. Can other upcoming releases ride that wave? Perhaps that's why Sony Pictures just released the first eight minutes of its much-delayed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter_(film)"><em>Kraven the Hunter.</em></a> which opens in 10 days.</p>
<p>Comic book fans are well acquainted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter">with Kraven</a> as one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/kraven-the-hunters-new-trailer-gives-us-a-dark-gore-filled-revenge-story/">Spider-Man's most formidable foes</a>, a founding member of the Sinister Six. He's a Russian immigrant with an aristocratic background who fled his home country when Tsar Nicholas II's reign collapsed in 1917. He's a big-game hunter with enhanced abilities thanks to ingesting a mysterious potion made from jungle herbs. He's very hard to injure and has super-human strength and enhanced sight, hearing, and smell, and he's a good tactician with excellent hand-to-hand combat skills.</p>
<p>The film version appears to be an origin story. Per the official premise:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/sony-just-released-the-first-8-minutes-of-kraven-the-hunter/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX recently hit some notable milestones with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, and even in the full context of history, the performance of the vehicle is pretty incredible.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, the company launched a batch of Starlink v2-mini satellites from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket, marking the 400th successful mission by the Falcon 9 rocket. Additionally, it was the Falcon program's 375th booster recovery, <a href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1862742802796573109">according to SpaceX</a>. Finally, with this mission, the company shattered its record for turnaround time from the landing of a booster to its launch to 13 days and 12 hours, down from 21 days.</p>
<p>But even though it was mere hours before the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, SpaceX was not done for the month. On Saturday, November 30, the company launched twice more in a little more than three hours. The payloads were more Starlink Internet satellites in addition to two Starshield satellites—a custom version of Starlink for the US Department of Defense—for the US military.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/spacex-has-set-all-kinds-of-records-with-its-falcon-9-rocket-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In a surprise move, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has stepped down as head of the company after less than four years, as reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retire-2024-12-02/">Reuters</a> and other outlets. The change caps a chaotic year for Intel, which is poised to report its first annual financial loss since 1986 and <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2024/08/intel-will-cut-16000-jobs-after-more-disappointing-financial-results.html">announced layoffs of at least 15,000 employees this year</a> as it attempted to cut costs.</p>
<p>Intel CFO David Zinsner and Client Computing Group head Michelle Johnston Holthaus will be sharing the title of interim CEO while the company's board of directors searches for a new CEO. Gelsinger has also stepped down from his seat on the board.</p>
<p>A statement from board chair Frank Yeary suggests that Intel plans to continue Gelsinger's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/intel-slipped-and-its-future-now-depends-on-making-everyone-elses-chips/">signature push into the chip foundry business</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-steps-down-after-terrible-no-good-very-bad-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What happens when a gargantuan cloud of gas swallows a pair of monster black holes with their own appetites? Feasting on the gas can cause some weird (heavenly) bodily functions.</p>
<p>AT 2021hdr is a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH) system in the center of a <a href="https://www.wis-tns.org/object/2021hdr">galaxy</a> 1 billion light-years away, in the Cygnus constellation. In 2021, researchers observing it using NASA’s Zwicky Transient Facility saw strange outbursts that were flagged by the ALerCE (Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events) team.</p>
<p>This active galactic nucleus (AGN) flared so brightly that AT 2021hdr was almost mistaken for a supernova. Repeating flares soon ruled that out. When the researchers questioned whether they might be looking at a tidal disruption event—a star being torn to shreds by the black holes—something was still not making sense. They then compared observations they made in 2022 using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to simulations of something else they suspected: a tidal disruption of a gas cloud by binary supermassive black holes. It seemed they had found the most likely answer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/supermassive-black-hole-binary-emits-unexpected-flares/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you aren’t yet worried about the multitude of ways you inadvertently inflict suffering onto other living creatures, you will be after reading <a href="https://www.edgeofsentience.com"><em>The Edge of Sentience</em> by Jonathan Birch</a>. And for good reason. Birch, a Professor of Philosophy at the London College of Economics and Political Science, was one of a team of experts chosen by the UK government to establish the Animal Welfare Act (or Sentience Act) in 2022—a law that protects animals whose sentience status is unclear.</p>
<p>According to Birch, even insects may possess sentience, which he defines as the capacity to have valenced experiences, or experiences that feel good or bad. At the very least, Birch explains, insects (as well as all vertebrates and a selection of invertebrates) are sentience candidates: animals that may be conscious and, until proven otherwise, should be regarded as such.</p>
<p>Although it might be a stretch to wrap our mammalian minds around insect sentience, it is not difficult to imagine that fellow vertebrates have the capacity to experience life, nor does it come as a surprise that even some invertebrates, such as octopuses and other cephalopod mollusks (squid, cuttlefish, and nautilus) qualify for sentience candidature. In fact, one species of octopus, <em>Octopus vulgaris</em>, has been protected by the UK’s Animal Scientific Procedures Act (ASPA) since 1986, which illustrates how long we have been aware of the possibility that invertebrates might be capable of experiencing valenced states of awareness, such as contentment, fear, pleasure, and pain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/how-should-we-treat-beings-that-might-be-sentient/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have discovered malicious code circulating in the wild that hijacks the earliest stage boot process of Linux devices by exploiting a year-old firmware vulnerability when it remains unpatched on affected models.</p>
<p>The critical vulnerability is one of a constellation of exploitable flaws discovered last year and given the name <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/just-about-every-windows-and-linux-device-vulnerable-to-new-logofail-firmware-attack/">LogoFAIL</a>. These exploits are able to override an industry-standard defense known as Secure Boot and execute malicious firmware early in the boot process. Until now, there were no public indications that LogoFAIL exploits were circulating in the wild.</p>
<p>The discovery of code downloaded from an Internet-connected web server changes all that. While there are no indications the public exploit is actively being used, it is reliable and polished enough to be production-ready and could pose a threat in the real world in the coming weeks or months. Both the LogoFAIL vulnerabilities and the exploit found on-line were discovered by Binarly, a firm that helps customers identify and secure vulnerable firmware.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/code-found-online-exploits-logofail-to-install-bootkitty-linux-backdoor/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Today’s young adults grew up in a time when their childhoods were documented with smartphone cameras instead of dedicated digital or film cameras. It’s not surprising that, perhaps as a reaction to the ubiquity of the phone, some young creative photographers are leaving their handsets in their pockets in favor of compact point-and-shoot digital cameras—the very type that camera manufacturers are actively discontinuing.</p>
<p>Much of the buzz among this creative class has centered around premium, chic models like the <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-compact-cameras-for-photo-and-video/">Fujifilm X100 and Ricoh GR</a>, or for the self-anointed “digicam girlies” on TikTok, zoom point-and-shoots like the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@autumrainn/video/7363060932374760734" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@autumrainn/video/7363060932374760734" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/@autumrainn/video/7363060932374760734"}'>Canon PowerShot G7</a> and Sony RX100 models, which can be great for selfies.</p>
<p>But other shutterbugs are reaching back into the past 20 years or more to add a vintage “Y2K aesthetic” to their work. The MySpace look is strong with a lot of photographers shooting with authentic early-2000s “digicams,” aiming their cameras—flashes a-blazing—at their friends and capturing washed-out, low-resolution, grainy photos that look a whole lot like 2003.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/vintage-digicams-arent-just-a-fad-theyre-an-artistic-statement/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"Am I the first person to discover this?" is a tricky question when it comes to classic Macs, some of the most pored-over devices on the planet. But there's a lot to suggest that user paul.gaastra, on the 68kMLA vintage Mac forum, has been right for more than a decade: One of the capacitors on the Apple mid-'90s Mac LC III was installed backward due to faulty silkscreen printing on the board.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Apple will issue a factory recall for the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/112230">LC III</a>—or the related LC III+, or Performa models 450, 460, 466, or 467 with the same board design. The "pizza box" models, sold from 1993–1996, came with <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/304879620202">a standard 90-day warranty</a>, and most of them probably ran without issue. It's when people try to fix up these boards and replace the capacitors, in what is generally a good practice (re-capping), that they run into trouble.</p>

Now, having "bought a Performa 450 complete with its original leaky capacitors," he can double-check Apple's board layout 30 years later and <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2024/11/the-capacitor-that-apple-soldered-incorrectly-at-the-factory/">detail it all in a blog post</a> (seen originally at <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/11/27/the-capacitor-that-apple-soldered-incorrectly-at-the-factory/">the Adafruit blog</a>).
