              <![CDATA[<p>BOCA CHICA BEACH, Texas—I've taken some time to process what happened on the mudflats of South Texas a little more than a week ago and relived the scene in my mind countless times.</p>
<p>With each replay, it's still as astonishing as it was when I saw it on October 13, standing on an elevated platform less than 4 miles away. It was surreal watching SpaceX's enormous 20-story-tall Super Heavy rocket booster plummeting through the sky before being caught back at its launch pad by giant mechanical arms.</p>
<p>This is the way, according to SpaceX, to enable a future where it's possible to rapidly reuse rockets, not too different from the way airlines turn around their planes between flights. This is required for SpaceX to accomplish the company's mission, set out by Elon Musk two decades ago, of building a settlement on Mars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/after-seeing-hundreds-of-launches-spacexs-rocket-catch-was-a-new-thrill/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile and AT&amp;T say US regulators should drop a plan to require unlocking of phones within 60 days of activation, claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. "If the Commission mandates a uniform unlocking policy, it is consumers—not providers—who stand to lose the most," T-Mobile alleged in an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1017178290200/1">October 17 filing</a> with the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p>The proposed rule has support from consumer advocacy groups who say it will give users more choice and lower their costs. T-Mobile has been criticized for locking phones for up to a year, which makes it impossible to use a phone on a rival's network. T-Mobile claims that with a 60-day unlocking rule, "consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force providers to reduce the line-up of their most compelling handset offers."</p>
<p>If the proposed rule is enacted, "T-Mobile estimates that its prepaid customers, for example, would see subsidies reduced by 40 percent to 70 percent for both its lower and higher-end devices, such as the Moto G, Samsung A15, and iPhone 12," the carrier said. "A handset unlocking mandate would also leave providers little choice but to limit their handset offers to lower cost and often lesser performing handsets."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/t-mobile-att-oppose-unlocking-rule-claim-locked-phones-are-good-for-users/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>37Signals is not a company that makes its policy or management decisions quietly.</p>
<p>The productivity software company was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/10/5691/">an avowedly Mac-centric shop</a> until <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/apple-under-fire-for-disabling-iphone-web-apps-eu-asks-developers-to-weigh-in/">Apple's move to kill home screen web apps</a> (or Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs) led the firm and its very-public-facing co-founder, David Heinemeier Hansson, to declare a "<a href="https://x.com/dhh/status/1765412689130758313?prefetchTimestamp=1729528154263">Return to Windows</a>," followed by a <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/linux-as-the-new-developer-default-at-37signals-ef0823b7">stew of Windows/Mac/Linux</a>. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/why-one-email-app-went-to-war-with-apple-and-why-neither-one-is-right/">waged a public battle with Apple</a> over its App Store subscription policies, and the resulting outcry helped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/apple-opens-new-appeals-channel-for-devs-frustrated-by-app-store-guidelines/">nudge Apple a bit</a>. 37Signals has <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/">maintained an active blog for years</a>, its co-founders and employees have written <a href="https://37signals.com/books/">numerous business advice books</a>, and its blog and social media posts regularly hit the front pages of Hacker News.</p>
<p>So when 37Signals decided to pull its seven cloud-based apps off Amazon Web Services <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0">in the fall of 2022</a>, it didn't do so quietly or without details. Back then, Hansson described his firm as paying "an at times almost absurd premium" for defense against "wild swings or towering peaks in usage." In early 2023, Hansson wrote that 37Signals expected to save $7 million over five years by buying more than $600,000 worth of Dell server gear and hosting its own apps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/basecamp-maker-37signals-says-its-cloud-exit-will-save-it-10m-over-5-years/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>She suspects all of these things can trigger her migraine attacks, which manifest in a variety of ways: pounding pain in the back of her head, exquisite sensitivity to the slightest sound, even blackouts and partial paralysis.</p>
<p>Irons, 48, of Coral Springs, Florida, once worked as a school assistant principal. Now, she’s on disability due to her migraine. Irons has tried so many migraine medications she’s lost count—but none has helped for long. Even a few of the much-touted new drugs that have quelled episodes for many people with migraine have failed for Irons.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/studies-of-migraines-many-triggers-offer-paths-to-new-therapies/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Star Trek franchise made its presence known with a special panel during New York City Comic-Con this past weekend. Among the highlights: Paramount unveiled a three-minute preview clip from the third season of <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em> and a clip from the upcoming final season of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>.</p>
<p>In other news, while the first season of new series <em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em> is still in production, Paramount has already renewed it for a second season and revealed that <em>Orphan Black</em> star Tatiana Maslany will be a recurring guest on the series. Tig Notaro, Oded Fehr, and Mary Wiseman will reprise their <em>Discovery</em> roles as Jett Reno, Admiral Vance, and Sylvia Tilly, respectively. And Robert Picardo of<em> Star Trek: Voyager</em> will be back as The Doctor—in a show set 900 years after the hologram physician first appeared.</p>
<p>The studio also announced an official premiere date and poster art for the <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> spinoff film <em>Section 31</em> starring Michelle Yeoh: January 24, 2025. Miku Martineau plays a young Phillipa Georgiou in the film, which will give us the backstory for Georgiou's evil Mirror Universe counterpart, where she was a despotic emperor who murdered millions of her own people. Meanwhile, Yeoh's older Georgiou is tasked with protecting the United Federation of Planets as part of a black ops group called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_31_(Star_Trek)">Section 31</a> while dealing with all the blood she's spilled in her past.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/paramount-drops-new-clip-for-strange-new-worlds-at-nycc/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After rumors swirled that TikTok owner ByteDance had lost tens of millions after an intern sabotaged its AI models, ByteDance issued a statement this weekend hoping to silence all the social media chatter in China.</p>
<p>In a social media <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/w/1813324433807370/?target_app=4916">post</a> translated and reviewed by Ars, ByteDance clarified "facts" about "interns destroying large model training" and confirmed that one intern was fired in August.</p>
<p>According to ByteDance, the intern had held a position in the company's commercial technology team but was fired for committing "serious disciplinary violations." Most notably, the intern allegedly "maliciously interfered with the model training tasks" for a ByteDance research project, ByteDance said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/bytedance-intern-fired-for-planting-malicious-code-in-ai-models/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Today, Mercedes-Benz opened its first battery-recycling plant in Germany. The new plant will use an "integrated mechanical-hydrometallurgical" approach to recycling electric vehicle batteries and expects to recover more than 96 percent of the valuable minerals and metals used in EV batteries.</p>
<p>"Mercedes-Benz has set itself the goal of building the most desirable cars in a sustainable way. As a pioneer in automotive engineering, Europe's first integrated mechanical-hydrometallurgical battery recycling factory marks a key milestone toward enhancing raw-materials sustainability," said Ola Källenius, chairman of the board of management Mercedes-Benz Group. "Together with our partners from industry and science, we are sending a strong signal of innovative strength for sustainable electric mobility and value creation in Germany and Europe."</p>
<p>The plant, which is located in Kuppenheim, Germany, shreds the battery modules then uses a mechanical process to separate plastics, copper, aluminum, and iron. The resulting "black mass" is then subjected to a hydrometallurgical process that extracts the cobalt, nickel, and lithium. The plant runs entirely on electricity generated by solar panels and has an annual capacity of 2,756 tons (2,500 tonnes). While this is not especially high, Mercedes says it will use the knowledge it gains to scale up volumes over time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/mercedes-benz-opens-its-own-recycling-facility-for-ev-batteries/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like nuclear fusion, the idea of space-based solar power has always seemed like a futuristic technology with an actual deployment into communities ever remaining a couple of decades away.</p>
<p>The concept of harvesting solar power continuously from large satellites in space—where there are no nights, no clouds, and no atmosphere to interfere with the collection of photons—is fairly simple. Large solar arrays in geostationary orbit collect solar energy and beam it back to Earth via microwaves as a continuous source of clean energy.</p>
<p>However, implementing this technology is not so simple. In recent years, in search of long-term power solutions and concerned about climate change, the European Space Agency has been studying space-based solar power. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/european-space-chief-says-continent-will-lead-in-space-based-solar-power/">Some initial studies found</a> that a plan to meet one-third of Europe's energy needs would require massive amounts of infrastructure and cost hundreds of billions of dollars. At best, such a system of very large satellites in geostationary space might come online by the middle of this century.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/solar-power-from-space-actually-it-might-happen-in-a-couple-of-years/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's been almost exactly a year now since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/star-citizens-squadron-42-campaign-is-feature-complete-after-11-years/">we reported on the announcement</a> that <em>Squadron 42</em>—the single-player campaign portion of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/11/star-citizens-6-3-million-haul-breaks-gaming-crowdfunding-record/">now 12-year-old crowdfunding boondoggle <em>Star Citizen</em></a>—was "feature complete" and in the "polish phase." Now, many years after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/star-citizen-production-schedule-release/">the game's original 2015 release target</a>, developer Roberts Space Industries (RSI) says that, with just a year or two of additional "polish," the game will finally launch sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement came during this weekend's CitizenCon, per IGN, where RSI founder and CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H-0x4xk2Xk">showed off a roughly hour-long prologue</a> of the game's promised 30- to 40-hour storyline. IGN also reported that the live on-stage demo suffered "a number of crashes, bugs, and graphical problems," which helps explain why a little more time is needed to get from "feature complete" to "actual release."</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1H-0x4xk2Xk?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>"We did say we were doing it live, risking the demo gods, and they brought their wrath down on us," Roberts said on stage, according to the IGN report. "Both the team and I are confident of giving you this game in 2026. Obviously, you can see it’s not going to be tomorrow because you saw a few crashes there."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/originally-planned-for-2015-squadron-42s-latest-delay-pushes-it-to-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Volkswagen provided flights from Washington, DC, to San Francisco and accommodation so Ars could drive the ID Buzz. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO—In all the years we've been writing about cars, very few vehicles have generated as much attention as the Volkswagen ID Buzz. At a time when SUVs look increasingly threatening, the Buzz seems like an antidote, with gentle curves and something of a friendly grin at the front. Plus, people are starting to get desperate for an electric minivan option, if audience feedback is anything to go by. It's been a long wait for the North American-spec Buzz, but that is almost over, with the first customer cars due in dealerships in November. Read on to discover what we found out driving it around the Bay Area last week.</p>
<p>VW first showed off the Buzz a good seven years ago. It was the fourth time the company tried to reimagine the classic Kombi for the 21st century but the first time that production got the go-ahead. That was in large part thanks to a new flexible electric vehicle platform developed in the wake of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">Dieselgate</a>. Other more mainstream VW EVs were needed first, however, and it was 2022 before a short-wheelbase version of the Buzz went on sale in Europe as a five-seater family car and also a commercial van.</p>
<p>We drove that one in Denmark, and while it was just as much of an attention-grabber there as it will be here, the short-wheelbase version was too compromised for US tastes. And it was too expensive, despite its smaller battery. European pricing had me pessimistic about the three-row, big battery model, but the rear-wheel drive Buzz Pro S starts at $59,995.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/driving-the-2025-vw-id-buzz-was-worth-the-seven-year-wait/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This is not the smallest tropical cyclone—as defined by sustained winds greater than 39 mph, or 63 kph—as that record remains held by Tropical Storm Marco back in 2008.

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Space Force's Space Systems Command announced Friday it has ordered nine launches from SpaceX in the first batch of dozens of missions the military will buy in a new phase of competition for lucrative national security launch contracts.</p>
<p>The nine launches are divided into two fixed-price "task orders" that Space Systems Command opened up for bids earlier this year. One covers seven launches with groups of spacecraft for the Space Development Agency's constellation of missile tracking and data relay satellites. The other task order is for two missions for the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government's spy satellite agency.</p>
<h2>Two eligible bidders</h2>
<p>The parameters of the competition limited the bidders to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA). SpaceX won both task orders for a combined value of $733.5 million, or roughly $81.5 million per mission. Six of the nine missions will launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, beginning as soon as late 2025. The other three will launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, a Space Systems Command spokesperson told Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/spacex-sweeps-latest-round-of-military-launch-contracts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maximumfun/comments/3na6mj/jjho_settled_law/">a matter of settled law</a> on <a href="https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/judge-john-hodgman/">the <em>Judge John Hodgman</em> podcast</a> that people like what they like, and you can't force someone to like something. It is called the Tom Waits Principle.</p>
<p>I thought about that principle constantly while I was trying to open myself up to <a href="https://www.mw5clans.com/"><em>MechWarrior 5: Clans</em></a>. Trying to jump into this game and like it, so that I'd have some critical assessment of it, was akin to handing a friend <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Rider_(album)">The Black Rider</a> </em>and assuming they would come back begging for more.</p>
<p>From everything I can tell and what I have read, this game largely delivers on the simulation, and notably a lot of the story, that <em>BattleTech</em>/<em>MechWarrior</em> fans revere. <em>Clans</em> seems very good at what it sets out to do, and I do get the sense that it is relatively accommodating to newcomers compared to other entries. It just did not, despite its stand-alone nature and alleged newcomer friendliness, convert me into a loadout tactician or stomp-and-shoot enthusiast.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/i-tried-to-get-into-mechwarrior-5-clans-as-a-newcomer-but-its-for-the-fans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Evolution has turned out bizarre and baffling creatures, such as walking fish. It only gets weirder from there. Some of these fish not only walk on the seafloor, but use their leg-like appendages to taste for signs of prey that might be hiding.</p>
<p>Most species of sea robins are bottom-dwellers that both swim and crawl around on “legs” that extend from their pectoral fins. An international team of researchers has now discovered that the legs of the northern sea robin, <i>Prionotus carolinus, </i>double as sensory organs. They are covered in bumps called papillae (similar to those on a human tongue) with taste receptors that detect chemical stimuli coming from buried prey. If they taste something appetizing, they will dig for their next meal.</p>
<p>There is more to this fish than its extraordinary way of hunting. Analysis of <i>P. carolinus </i>genes found that a gene that may date back to the origin of animals controls the formation of both legs and sensory papillae, which hints at how they might have evolved.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/bizarre-fish-has-sensory-legs-it-uses-for-walking-and-tasting/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US District Judge Mark Walker had a blunt message for the Florida surgeon general in an order halting the government official's attempt to censor a political ad that opposes restrictions on abortion.</p>
<p>"To keep it simple for the State of Florida: it's the First Amendment, stupid," Walker, an Obama appointee who is chief judge in US District Court for the Northern District of Florida, wrote yesterday in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.527759/gov.uscourts.flnd.527759.25.0.pdf">ruling that granted a temporary restraining order</a>.</p>
<p>"Whether it's a woman's right to choose, or the right to talk about it, Plaintiff's position is the same—'don't tread on me,'" Walker wrote later in the ruling. "Under the facts of this case, the First Amendment prohibits the State of Florida from trampling on Plaintiff's free speech."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-slams-florida-for-censoring-political-ad-its-the-first-amendment-stupid/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fresh water we can use for drinking or agriculture is only about 3 percent of the global water supply, and nearly 70 percent of that is trapped in glaciers and ice caps. So far, that was enough to keep us going, but severe draughts have left places like Jordan, Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, Spain, and California with limited access to potable water.</p>
<p>One possible solution is to tap into the remaining 97 percent of the water we have on Earth. The problem is that this water is saline, and we need to get the salt out of it to make it drinkable. Desalination is also an energy-expensive process. But MIT researchers led by Jonathan Bessette might have found an answer to that. They built an efficient, self-regulating water desalination system that runs on solar power alone with no need for batteries or a connection to the grid.</p>
<h2>Probing the groundwaters</h2>
<p>Oceans are the most obvious source of water for desalination. But they are a good option only for a small portion of people who live in coastal areas. Most of the global population—more or less 60 percent—lives farther than 100 kilometers from the coast, which makes using desalinated ocean water infeasible. So, Bessette and his team focused on groundwater instead.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/desalination-system-adjusts-itself-to-work-with-renewable-power/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, it was reported that the US Department of Commerce is investigating the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) over suspicions that the chipmaker may have been subverting <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5G-Myth_Fact3-508.pdf">5G export controls</a> to make "artificial intelligence or smartphone chips for the Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies," sources with direct knowledge <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/u-s-probes-tsmcs-dealings-with-huawei">told The Information</a>.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce has yet to officially announce the probe and declined Ars' request for comment. But TSMC promptly issued a statement today, defending itself as "a law-abiding company" that's "committed to complying with laws and regulations, including export controls."</p>
<p>For the past four years, the US has considered Huawei a national security risk after Huawei allegedly <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/pdfs/2447-huawei-entity-listing-faqs/file">provided financial services to Iran</a>, violating another <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/topic/1551#:~:text=contain%20blocking%20provisions.-,E.O.,statute%20or%20authorized%20by%20OFAC.">US export control</a>. In that time, US-China tensions have intensified, with the US increasingly imposing tariffs to limit China's access to US tech, most recently <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/">increasing tariffs on semiconductors</a>. As competitiveness over AI dominance has heightened, Congress also recently introduced a <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MCCAUL_128_xml-ENFORCE-Act.pdf">bill</a> to stop China and other foreign adversaries from accessing American-made AI and AI-enabling technologies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/us-suspects-tsmc-helped-huawei-skirt-export-controls-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X updated its <a href="https://x.com/en/tos">terms of service</a> to steer user lawsuits to US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, the same court where a judge who bought Tesla stock is overseeing an X lawsuit against the nonprofit Media Matters for America.</p>
<p>The new terms that apply to users of the X social network say that all disputes related to the terms "will be brought exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas, United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those forums and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum."</p>
<p>X recently moved its headquarters from San Francisco to Texas, but the new headquarters are not in the Northern District or Tarrant County. X's headquarters are in Bastrop, the county seat of Bastrop County, which is served by US District Court for the <a href="https://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/court-information/office-locations/">Western District of Texas</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/xs-new-terms-steer-lawsuits-to-texas-court-where-judge-owns-tesla-stock/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/download/">released</a> an early Windows version of its first ChatGPT app for Windows, following a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/openais-chatgpt-for-mac-is-now-available-to-all-users/">Mac version</a> that launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">in May</a>. Currently, it's only available to subscribers of Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu versions of ChatGPT, and users can <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nt1r1c2hh7j">download it</a> for free in the Microsoft Store for Windows.</p>
<p>OpenAI is positioning the release as a beta test. "This is an early version, and we plan to bring the full experience to all users later this year," OpenAI writes on the Microsoft Store entry for the app. (Interestingly, ChatGPT shows up as being rated "T for Teen" by the ESRB in the Windows store, despite not being a video game.)</p>

<p>Upon opening the app, OpenAI requires users to log into a paying ChatGPT account, and from there, the app is basically identical to the web browser version of ChatGPT. You can currently use it to access several models: GPT-4o, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openais-canvas-eases-collaborations-with-chatgpt/">GPT-4o with Canvas</a>, 01-preview, 01-mini, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4. Also, it can generate images using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">DALL-E 3</a> or analyze uploaded files and images.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openai-releases-chatgpt-app-for-windows/">Read full article</a></p>
