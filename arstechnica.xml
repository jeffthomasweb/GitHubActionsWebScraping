<p>SpaceX will fly the first-ever human spaceflight over the Earth’s poles, possibly before the end of this year, the company announced Monday. The private Crew Dragon mission will be led by a Chinese-born cryptocurrency entrepreneur named Chun Wang, and he will be joined by a polar explorer, a roboticist, and a filmmaker whom he has befriended in recent years.</p>
<p>The "Fram2" mission, named after the <a href="https://frammuseum.no/polar-history/vessels/the-polar-ship-fram/">Norwegian research ship Fram</a>, will launch into a polar corridor from SpaceX's launch facilities in Florida and fly directly over the north and south poles. The three-to-five day mission is being timed to fly over Antarctica near the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, to afford maximum lighting.</p>
<p>The four-person crew will fly, fittingly, aboard Crew Dragon <em>Endurance</em>, which is named after Ernest Shackleton's famous ship that was trapped in the Antarctic ice and eventually sunk there about a century ago. The spacecraft will be fitted with a cupola for both photography and filming.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042678#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042678&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A scientific journal has retracted three studies underpinning the clinical development of MDMA—aka ecstasy—as a psychedelic treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. The move came just a day after news broke that the Food and Drug Administration rejected the treatment, despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/mdma-aka-ecstasy-submitted-to-fda-as-part-of-ptsd-therapy/">positive results reported from two Phase III clinical trials</a>.</p>
<p>On Friday, the company developing the therapy, Lykos Therapeutics, <a href="https://news.lykospbc.com/2024-08-09-Lykos-Therapeutics-Announces-Complete-Response-Letter-for-Midomafetamine-Capsules-for-PTSD">announced that it had received a rejection letter from the FDA</a>. Lykos said the letter echoed the numerous <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/fdas-review-of-mdma-for-ptsd-highlights-study-bias-and-safety-concerns/">concerns raised previously by the agency</a> and its expert advisory committee, which, in June, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/">voted </a><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/">overwhelmingly </a><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/">against approving the therapy</a>. The FDA and its advisors identified flaws in the design of the clinical trials, missing data, and a variety of biases in people involved with the trials, including an alleged cult-like support of psychedelics. Lykos is a commercial spinoff of the psychedelic advocacy nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).</p>
<p>FDA advisors also noted the <a href="https://qz.com/1809184/psychedelic-therapy-has-a-sexual-abuse-problem-3">public allegations of a sexual assault</a> of a trial participant during a Phase II trial by an unlicensed therapist providing the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042683#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042683&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark">great white shark</a> (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>) is a swift and mighty hunter, capable of reaching speeds as high as 6.7 m/s when breaching, although it prefers to swim at slower speeds for migration and while waiting for prey. A team of Japanese researchers has studied the structure of the great white's skin to learn more about how these creatures adapt so well to a wide range of speeds. Their findings could lead to more efficient aircraft and boats with greatly reduced drag, according to a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0063">recent paper</a> published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/the-secret-of-how-the-mako-shark-swims-so-fast-lies-in-its-flexible-scales/">previously reported</a>, anyone who has touched a shark knows the skin feels smooth if you stroke from nose to tail. Reverse the direction, however, and it feels like sandpaper. That's because of tiny translucent scales, roughly 0.2 millimeters in size, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissacristinamarquez/2019/03/04/spilling-the-secret-to-a-mako-sharks-speed/#33ad9b1e02ea">called "denticles"</a> (because they strongly resemble teeth) all over the shark's body, especially concentrated in the animal's flanks and fins. It's like a suit of armor for sharks and it also serves as a means of reducing drag in the water while swimming.</p>
<p>Pressure drag is the result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_separation">flow separation</a> around an object, like an aircraft or the body of a mako shark as it moves through water; the magnitude of pressure drag is determined by the shape of the object. It's what happens when the fluid flow separates from the surface of an object, forming eddies and vortices that impede the object's movement. Since the shark's body is constantly undulating as it swims, it needs something to help keep the flow attached around that body to reduce that drag. Denticles serve that purpose.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042552#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042552&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This effectively ends Russian content creators' ability to monetize their posts, including YouTube videos. The change impacts accounts monetizing content through AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager, the support page said.</p>
<p>While Google has declined requests to provide details on what prompted the change, it's the latest escalation of Google's ongoing battle with Russian officials working to control the narrative on Russia's war with Ukraine.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042637#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042637&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Children's Health Defense (CHD), an anti-vaccine group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, has once again failed to convince a court that Meta acted as a state agent when censoring the group's posts and ads on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Childrens-Health-Defense-v-Meta-Opinion-8-9-2024.pdf">opinion</a> affirming a lower court's dismissal, US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Eric Miller wrote that CHD failed to prove that Meta acted as an arm of the government in censoring posts. Concluding that Meta's right to censor views that the platforms find "distasteful" is protected by the First Amendment, Miller denied CHD's requested relief, which had included an injunction and civil monetary damages.</p>
<p>"Meta evidently believes that vaccines are safe and effective and that their use should be encouraged," Miller wrote. "It does not lose the right to promote those views simply because they happen to be shared by the government."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042567#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042567&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A patent lawsuit filed by one of 3D printing's most established firms against a consumer-focused upstart could have a big impact on the wider 3D-printing scene.</p>
<p>In two complaints, (<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txed.232140/gov.uscourts.txed.232140.1.0.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://insight.rpxcorp.com/litigation_documents/15797606">2</a>, PDF) filed in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/08/why-patent-trolls-go-to-east-texas-explained/">the Eastern District of Texas</a>, Marshall Division, against six entities related to Bambu Lab, Stratasys alleges that Bambu Lab infringed upon 10 patents that it owns, some through subsidiaries like Makerbot (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/old-school-3d-printing-firm-buys-a-hot-little-startup-makerbot-for-403m/">acquired in 2013</a>). Among the patents cited are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9421713B2/en">US9421713B2</a>, "Additive manufacturing method for printing three-dimensional parts with purge towers," and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9592660B2/en">US9592660B2</a>, "Heated build platform and system for three-dimensional printing methods."</p>
<p>There are not many, if any, 3D printers sold to consumers that do not have a heated bed, which prevents the first layers of a model from cooling during printing and potentially shrinking and warping the model. "Purge towers" (or "<a href="https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/parameter/prime-tower">prime towers</a>" in Bambu's parlance) allow for multicolor printing by providing a place for the filament remaining in a nozzle to be extracted and prevent bleed-over between colors. Stratasys' infringement claims also target some fundamental technologies around force detection and fused deposition modeling (FDM) that, like purge towers, are used by other 3D-printer makers that target entry-level and intermediate 3D-printing enthusiasts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042499#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042499&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Donald Trump may have coined a new term in his latest false attack on Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112944255426268462">pair</a> of <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112944258919007861">posts</a> on Truth Social over the weekend, the former president said that Vice President Kamala Harris "A.I.'d" photos of a huge crowd that showed up to see her speak at a Detroit airport campaign rally last week.</p>
<p>"There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.’d' it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!" Trump wrote. "She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the 'crowd' looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake 'crowds' at her speeches."</p>
<p>The Harris campaign responded with <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1822679561353535600">its own post</a> saying that the image is "an actual photo of a 15,000-person crowd for Harris-Walz in Michigan."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042525#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042525&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

(credit: Andrew Cunningham)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In October of 2017, Microsoft released a version of Windows 10 called the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/windows-10-fall-creators-update-lots-of-small-changes-and-maybe-the-revolution/2/">Fall Creators Update</a>," back when the company tried to give brand names to these things rather than just sticking to version numbering. One of the new apps included in that update was called Paint 3D, and while it shared a name with the old two-dimensional MS Paint app, it was entirely new software that supported creating 3D shapes and a whole bunch of other editing and transform options that the old Paint app didn't have.</p>
<p>For the briefest of moments, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/windows-paint-is-now-officially-not-getting-updated-any-more/">planned to deprecate the classic 2D version of the Paint app</a> and focus its development resources on Paint 3D. But user outcry prompted Microsoft to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/07/24/ms-paint-stay/">cancel Paint’s cancelation</a> and move it into the Microsoft Store for easier updating. The company soon began adding new features to the app for the first time in years, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/saved-from-obsolescence-microsoft-is-now-making-paint-better/">starting with keyboard controls</a> and extending to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/ms-paint-gets-its-long-promised-dark-mode-along-with-other-improvements/">a redesigned UI</a>, support for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/hell-freezes-over-ms-paint-adds-support-for-layers-and-png-transparency/">layers and PNG transparency</a>, and integrated AI-powered image generation.</p>

<p>But the old Paint app's renaissance is coming at the expense of Paint 3D, which Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features">says</a> is formally being deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store on November 4. Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-kicks-the-bucket-with-paint-3d-will-deprecate-the-app-later-this-year">reports</a> that users of the app will be notified via a banner message, just in case they aren't regularly checking Microsoft's documentation page for the list of deprecated and removed Windows features.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042481#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042481&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>My first real taste of space journalism came on the morning of February 1, 2003. An editor at the Houston Chronicle telephoned me at home on a Saturday morning and asked me to hurry to Johnson Space Center to help cover the loss of Space Shuttle <em>Columbia</em>.</p>
<p>At the time, I did not realize this tragedy would set the course for the rest of my professional life, that of thinking and writing about spaceflight. This would become the consuming passion of my career.</p>
<p>I've naturally been thinking a lot about <em>Columbia</em> in recent weeks. While the parallels between that Space Shuttle mission and the first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft are not exact, there are similarities. Most significantly, after the Space Shuttle launched, there were questions about the safety of the vehicle's return home due to foam striking the leading edge of the spacecraft's wing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042431#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042431&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/tesla-wants-to-reinvent-the-pickup-with-the-39900-cybertruck/">first unveiled the Cybertruck</a> in 2019, the angular pickup was pitched right at the heart of the highly competitive truck market. With a promised starting price of $39,900, the single-motor version ever so slightly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/ford-reveals-pricing-for-the-f-150-lightning-pro-work-truck/">undercut the cheapest version</a> of Ford's electric F-150 Lightning. Tesla increased the entry-level price by more than $20,000 by the time the Cybertruck was actually getting close to production, with promises of deliveries in 2025. But now, all mention of the cheaper rear-wheel drive Cybertruck is gone from Tesla's ordering page.</p>
<p>Although pickup trucks have dominated new vehicle sales in the US for decades, their buyers are not exactly clamoring to swap their V8s or diesels for a slab of batteries and some electric motors. Ford has been finding that out the hard way—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/ford-slashes-f-150-lightning-ev-prices-by-up-to-9979/">a constant string of price changes</a> have helped keep demand depressed enough that the Blue Oval is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/fords-q1-ev-sales-grew-86-but-its-shifting-focus-to-hybrids/">shifting its entire electric vehicle strategy</a> as a result.</p>
<p>And the F-150 Lightning has the advantage of looking just like all the other F-150s that roll off the production line. Not so the Cybertruck, a vehicle that manages to look <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/the-tesla-cybertruck-finally-goes-on-sale-starting-at-60990/">even less elegant</a> when you see one in the wild rather than on a screen.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042478#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042478&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As soon as this week, NASA officials will make perhaps the agency's most consequential safety decision in human spaceflight in 21 years.</p>
<p>NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are nearly 10 weeks into a test flight that was originally set to last a little more than one week. The two retired US Navy test pilots were the first people to fly into orbit on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft when it launched on June 5. Now, NASA officials aren't sure Starliner is safe enough to bring the astronauts home.</p>
<p>Three of the managers at the center of the pending decision, Ken Bowersox and Steve Stich from NASA and Boeing's LeRoy Cain, either had key roles in the ill-fated final flight of Space Shuttle <em>Columbia </em>in 2003 or felt the consequences of the accident.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042347#p3">Read 46 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042347&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TikTok has been sending inaccurate and misleading news-style alerts to users’ phones, including a false claim about Taylor Swift and a weeks-old disaster warning, intensifying fears about the spread of misinformation on the popular video-sharing platform.</p>
<p>Among alerts seen by the Financial Times was a warning about a tsunami in Japan, labeled “BREAKING,” that was posted in late January, three weeks after an earthquake had struck.</p>
<p>Other notifications falsely stated that “Taylor Swift Canceled All Tour Dates in What She Called ‘Racist Florida’” and highlighted a five-year “ban” for a US baseball player that originated as an April Fool’s day prank.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042447#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042447&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6voXgBlmpk?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Jude Law plays a Jedi in <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em>. </p></div>
<p>The Star Wars universe continues to expand on streaming television with the release of the first trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Skeleton_Crew"><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em></a> this weekend at Disney's annual D23 Expo. The eight-episode standalone series is set in the same timeframe as <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>Ahsoka</em>.</p>
<p>Executive Producer Kathleen Kennedy was intrigued when series co-creator Jon Watts pitched a Star Wars series inspired by the 1985 film <em>The Goonies</em>. (Kennedy had co-produced that film and co-founded Amblin Entertainment.) She told co-creator Christopher Ford that <em>The Goonies</em> hadn't been created specifically for kids, instead telling a story that just happened to be about kids going on an adventure. So Ford and Watts wrote <em>Skeleton Crew</em> with the same mindset: a show for everyone that just happened to feature kids as the central characters. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Skeleton Crew</em> follows the journey of four kids who make a mysterious discovery on their seemingly safe home planet, then get lost in a strange and dangerous galaxy, crossing paths with the likes of Jod Na Nawood, the mysterious character played by [Jude] Law. Finding their way home—and meeting unlikely allies and enemies—will be a greater adventure than they ever imagined.</p></blockquote>

<p>Around half a billion years ago, in what is now the Yunnan Province of China, a tiny larva was trapped in mud. Hundreds of millions of years later, after the mud had long since become the black shales of the Yuan’shan formation, the larva surfaced again, a meticulously preserved time capsule that would unearth more about the evolution of arthropods.</p>
<p><i>Youti yuanshi </i>is barely visible to the naked eye. Roughly the size of a poppy seed, it is preserved so well that its exoskeleton is almost completely intact, and even the outlines of what were once its internal organs can be seen through the lens of a microscope. Durham University researchers who examined it were able to see features of both ancient and modern arthropods. Some of these features told them how the simpler, more wormlike ancestors of living arthropods evolved into more complex organisms.</p>
<p>The research team also found that <i>Y. yuanshi, </i>which existed during the Cambrian Explosion (when most of the main animal groups started to appear on the fossil record), has certain features in common with extant arthropods, such as crabs, velvet worms, and tardigrades. “The deep evolutionary position of <i>Youti yuanshi… </i>illuminat[es] the internal anatomical changes that propelled the rise and diversification of [arthropods],” they said in a study recently published in Nature.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041992#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041992&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Security flaws in your computer's firmware, the deep-seated code that loads first when you turn the machine on and controls even how its operating system boots up, have long been a target for hackers looking for a stealthy foothold. But only rarely does that kind of vulnerability appear not in the firmware of any particular computer maker, but in the chips found across hundreds of millions of PCs and servers. Now security researchers have found one such flaw that has persisted in AMD processors for decades, and that would allow malware to burrow deep enough into a computer's memory that, in many cases, it may be easier to discard a machine than to disinfect it.</p>
<p>At the Defcon hacker conference, Enrique Nissim and Krzysztof Okupski, researchers from the security firm IOActive, plan to present a vulnerability in AMD chips they're calling Sinkclose. The flaw would allow hackers to run their own code in one of the most privileged modes of an AMD processor, known as System Management Mode, designed to be reserved only for a specific, protected portion of its firmware. IOActive's researchers warn that it affects virtually all AMD chips dating back to 2006, or possibly even earlier.</p>

<p>Last November, Virgin Atlantic Airways made headlines for completing the world’s first transatlantic flight using “<a href="https://corporate.virginatlantic.com/gb/en/business-for-good/planet/fuel/flight100.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 percent sustainable aviation fuel</a>.”</p>
<p>This week, the Advertising Standard Authority (ASA) of the U.K. banned a Virgin radio ad released prior to the flight, in which they touted their “unique flight mission.” While Virgin did use fuel that releases fewer emissions than traditional supplies, the regulatory agency deemed the company’s sustainability claim “<a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/virgin-atlantic-airways-ltd-g23-1224417-virgin-atlantic-airways-ltd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misleading</a>” because it failed to give a full picture of the adverse environmental and climate impacts of fuel.</p>
<p>“It’s important that claims for sustainable aviation fuel spell out what the reality is, so consumers aren’t misled into thinking that the flight they are taking is greener than it really is,” Miles Lockwood, director of complaints and investigations at the ASA, said in a statement.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042237#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042237&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29co_Hksk6o&amp;t=213s">2022 CBS Sunday Morning segment</a>, CEO Stockton Rush of deep-water submersible company OceanGate gave journalist David Pogue a fun reveal. "We run the whole thing with this game controller," Rush said, holding up a Logitech F710 controller with 3D-printed thumbstick extensions. The controller was wireless, and it was the primary method for controlling the <em>Titan</em> submersible, which would soon make a visit to the wreck of the <em>Titanic</em>. Pogue laughed. "Come on!" he said, covering his eyes with his hand.</p>
<p>Journalists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/submarine-missing-near-titanic-used-a-30-logitech-gamepad-for-steering/">loved the controller story</a>, covering the inexpensive F710 and the ways that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/missing-titanic-sub-isnt-the-first-to-use-game-controls-for-heavy-machinery/">video game controllers have become common control solutions</a> in various military and spaceflight applications in recent years. After all, if your engineers and pilots grew up using two-stick controllers to waste their friends in <em>Halo</em> multiplayer, why not use that built-in muscle memory for other purposes?</p>
<p>So the use of a video game controller was not in itself a crazy decision. But after the <em>Titan</em> sub <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65934887">imploded</a> on a June 2023 dive to the <em>Titanic</em> site, killing all five passengers including Stockton Rush, the use of a wireless $30 control interface began to look less "cool!" and more "isn't that kind of risky?" The only question at that point was how long it would take the Logitech F710 to show up in a lawsuit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042370#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042370&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Inertial confinement fusion is one method for generating energy through nuclear fusion, albeit one plagued by all manner of scientific challenges (although progress <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/08/physicists-achieve-fusion-net-energy-gain-for-second-time/">is being made</a>). Researchers at LeHigh University are attempting to overcome one specific bugbear with this approach by conducting experiments with mayonnaise placed in a rotating figure-eight contraption. They described their most recent findings in a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.109.055103">new paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review E with an eye toward increasing energy yields from fusion.</p>
<p>The work builds on prior research in the LeHigh laboratory of mechanical engineer Arindam Banerjee, who focuses on investigating the dynamics of fluids and other materials in response to extremely high acceleration and centrifugal force. In this case, his team was exploring what's known as the "instability threshold" of elastic/plastic materials. Scientists have debated whether this comes about because of initial conditions, or whether it's the result of "more local catastrophic processes," according to Banerjee. The question is relevant to a variety of fields, including geophysics, astrophysics, explosive welding, and yes, inertial confinement fusion.</p>
<p>How exactly does inertial confinement fusion work? As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/12/partially-liquid-hydrogen-cooperates-with-lasers-for-better-fusion-yield/">Chris Lee explained for Ars</a> back in 2016:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042179#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042179&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T has been told to stop running ads that claim the carrier is already offering cellular coverage from space.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T intends to offer Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) and has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/google-and-att-invest-in-starlink-rival-for-satellite-to-smartphone-service/">deal with AST SpaceMobile</a>, a Starlink competitor that plans a smartphone service from low-Earth-orbit satellites.
