            <![CDATA[CEO Tim Cook says iPhones sell better in countries with Apple Intelligence.]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple fell slightly short of investor expectations when it reported its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">first-quarter earnings</a> today. While sales were up 4 percent overall, the iPhone showed signs of weakness, and sales in the Chinese market slipped by just over 11 percent.</p>
<p>CEO Tim Cook told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/apple-aapl-q1-earnings-2025.html">CNBC</a> that the iPhone performed better in countries where Apple Intelligence was available, like the US—seemingly suggesting that the slip was partially because Chinese consumers do not see enough reason to buy new phones without Apple Intelligence. (He also said, "Half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory.") iPhone sales also slipped in China during this same quarter last year; this was the first full quarter during which the iPhone 16 was available.</p>
<p>In any case, Cook said the company plans to roll out Apple Intelligence in additional languages, including Mandarin, this spring.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/q1-earnings-apple-sees-a-sales-slip-in-china-worrying-investors/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you've been paying careful attention to YouTube recently, you may have noticed the rising trend of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyntvjyx6fo">so-called "faceless YouTube channels"</a> that never feature a visible human talking in the video frame. While some of these channels are simply authored by camera-shy humans, many more are <a href="https://medium.com/@hazelparadise/how-i-created-a-faceless-youtube-channel-only-using-ai-ca9a60d200f7">fully automated through AI-powered tools</a> to craft everything from the scripts and voiceovers to the imagery and music. Unsurprisingly, this is often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC9lObRlJGPzpfMZ41gjBI3j0irljXMJY">sold</a> as a way to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-monetized-4-faceless-youtube-channels-my-first-16-months-guerra-0kgoe/">make a quick buck off the YouTube algorithm</a> with minimal human effort.</p>
<p>It's not hard to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW20Qy14llM">find</a> YouTubers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsa2DyCtIp0">complaining</a> about a flood of these faceless channels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3acdwwPfU">stealing their embedded transcript files</a> and <a href="https://www.summarizer.org/">running them through AI summarizers</a> to generate their own instant knock-offs. But one YouTuber is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDFUjqA1s8">trying to fight back</a>, seeding her transcripts with junk data that is invisible to humans but poisonous to any AI that dares to try to work from a poached transcript file.</p>
<h2>The power of the .ass</h2>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@f4micom">F4mi</a>, who creates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZV0cJnIZTY">some excellent deep dives</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G9n0vJiKXw">obscure technology</a>, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDFUjqA1s8">detailed her efforts</a> "to poison any AI summarizers that were trying to steal my content to make slop." The key to F4mi's method is <a href="http://www.tcax.org/docs/ass-specs.htm">the .ass subtitle format</a>, created decades ago as part of fansubbing software Advanced SubStation Alpha. Unlike simpler and more popular subtitle formats, .ass supports fancy features like fonts, colors, positioning, bold, italic, underline, and more.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-one-youtuber-is-trying-to-poison-the-ai-bots-stealing-her-content/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has ordered an investigation into NPR and PBS in a move that Democrats described as an attempt to intimidate the media.</p>
<p>"I am writing to inform you that I have asked the FCC's Enforcement Bureau to open an investigation regarding the airing of NPR and PBS programming across your broadcast member stations," Carr wrote in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/fcc_carr_letter_to_npr_pbs.pdf">letter</a> yesterday to the leaders of NPR and PBS.</p>
<p>Carr alleged that NPR and PBS are violating a federal law prohibiting noncommercial educational broadcast stations from running commercial advertisements. "I am concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials," Carr wrote. "In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-fcc-chair-investigates-npr-and-pbs-urges-congress-to-defund-them/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Video Game History Foundation has officially <a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/">opened up digital access</a> to a large portion of its massive archives today, offering fans and researchers unprecedented access to information and <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/ea5f4f15-2451-4936-bdba-6410130605f2">ephemera</a> surrounding the past 50 years of the game industry.</p>
<p>Today's launch of <a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/">the VGHF Library</a> comprises more than 30,000 indexed and curated files, including <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/a5823d80-320b-41c9-9e3c-4dc28f79f2a2">high-quality artwork</a>, promotional material, and searchable full-text archives over 1,500 video game magazine issues. This initial dump of digital materials also contains never-before-seen <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/03ee70ad-c9cc-45fb-b884-7ba239f71ac7">game development and production archival material</a> stored by the VGHF, such as <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/22cf9aa2-812b-4f39-b42e-e87a3c153b8c">over 100 hours of raw production files from the creation of the <em>Myst</em> series</a> or <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/af68253d-25b6-4fb9-8f8b-ea283b1de9a2"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> concept art and design files</a> contributed by artist Tom Payne.</p>
<h2>A labor of love</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://gamehistory.org/vghf-library-launch/">a blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tysm_Wf60Q">accompanying launch video</a>, VGHF head librarian Phil Salvador explains how today's launch is the culmination of a dream the organization has had since its launch in 2017. But it's also just the start of an ongoing process to digitize the VGHF's mountains of <a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/accessions">unprocessed physical material</a> into a cataloged digital form, so people can access it "without having to fly to California."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/vghf-opens-free-online-access-to-1500-classic-game-mags-30k-historic-files/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A cloud security firm found a publicly accessible, fully controllable database belonging to DeepSeek, the Chinese firm that has recently shaken up the AI world, "within minutes" of examining DeepSeek's security, <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-uncovers-exposed-deepseek-database-leak">according to a blog post by Wiz</a>.</p>
<p>An analytical ClickHouse database tied to DeepSeek, "completely open and unauthenticated," contained more than 1 million instances of "chat history, backend data, and sensitive information, including log streams, API secrets, and operational details," according to Wiz. An open web interface also allowed for full database control and privilege escalation, with internal API endpoints and keys available through the interface and common URL parameters.</p>
<p>"While much of the attention around AI security is focused on futuristic threats, the real dangers often come from basic risks—like accidental external exposure of databases," writes Gal Nagli at Wiz's blog. "As organizations rush to adopt AI tools and services from a growing number of startups and providers, it’s essential to remember that by doing so, we’re entrusting these companies with sensitive data. The rapid pace of adoption often leads to overlooking security, but protecting customer data must remain the top priority."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/report-deepseeks-chat-histories-and-internal-data-were-publicly-exposed/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/strengthening-americas-ai-leadership-with-the-us-national-laboratories/">announced</a> that it is deepening its ties with the US government through a partnership with the National Laboratories and expects to use AI to "supercharge" research across a wide range of fields to better serve the public.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"This is the beginning of a new era, where AI will advance science, strengthen national security, and support US government initiatives," OpenAI said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The deal ensures that "approximately 15,000 scientists working across a wide range of disciplines to advance our understanding of nature and the universe" will have access to OpenAI's latest reasoning models, the announcement said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/openai-partners-with-national-labs-to-supercharge-scientific-breakthroughs/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Op-ed: OpenAI says DeepSeek used its data improperly. That must be frustrating!]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT developer OpenAI and other players in the generative AI business were caught unawares this week by a Chinese company named DeepSeek, whose open source R1 simulated reasoning model provides <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">results similar to OpenAI's best paid models</a> (with some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/the-questions-the-chinese-government-doesnt-want-deepseek-ai-to-answer/">notable exceptions</a>) despite being created using just a fraction of the computing power.</p>
<p>Since ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and other generative AI models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">first became publicly available in late 2022</a> and 2023, the US AI industry has been undergirded by the assumption that you'd need ever-greater amounts of training data and compute power to continue improving their models and get—eventually, maybe—to a functioning version of artificial general intelligence, or AGI.</p>
<p>Those assumptions were reflected in everything from Nvidia's stock price to <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/30012025/inside-clean-energy-china-deepseek-ai/">energy investments</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/trump-announces-500b-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-with-agi-aims/">data center plans</a>. Whether DeepSeek fundamentally upends those plans remains to be seen. But at a bare minimum, it has shaken investors who have poured money into OpenAI, a company that reportedly believes it won't turn a profit <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-projections-imply-losses-tripling-to-14-billion-in-2026">until the end of the decade</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/i-agree-with-openai-you-shouldnt-use-other-peoples-work-without-permission/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/surface-pro-11-and-laptop-7-review-an-apple-silicon-moment-for-windows/">switched the Surface Pro tablet and both sizes of Surface Laptop</a> from Intel and AMD's processors to Qualcomm's Arm-based processors last summer, part of a renewed hardware and software push to make the Arm version of Windows a thing. That ended a few years of a bifurcated approach, where the Intel and AMD versions of Surface PCs were the "main" versions and the Arm variants felt more like proof-of-concept side projects.</p>
<p>But if you work in a large organization or you're an IT administrator, the bifurcated approach continues. Microsoft announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/microsoft-debuts-major-surface-overhauls-that-regular-people-cant-buy/">some business-only versions</a> of the Surface Pro tablet and the Surface Laptop last year that continued to use Intel processors, and <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/?p=263632">today it's announcing two more</a>, this time using Intel's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/testing-intels-next-gen-core-ultra-200v-cpus-ok-performance-great-battery-life/">Lunar Lake-based Core Ultra CPUs</a>.</p>
<p>The refresh includes a new Surface Pro tablet and both 13- and 15-inch versions of the Surface Laptop, updated with most of the same design tweaks that the Qualcomm versions of the devices got last year (for example, a slightly larger 13.8-inch screen on the smaller version of the Surface Laptop, up from 13.5 inches). Generally, they have similar dimensions, weights, and configuration options as their Arm counterparts, including an OLED display option for the Surface Pro.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/microsoft-updates-intel-based-surface-pcs-but-regular-people-still-cant-buy-them/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A bright fireball streaked across the sky above mountains, glaciers, and spruce forest near the town of Revelstoke in British Columbia, Canada, on the evening of March 31, 1965. <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/docs/mb34.pdf">Fragments of this meteorite</a>, discovered by beaver trappers, fell over a lake. A layer of ice saved them from the depths and allowed scientists a peek into the birth of the solar system.</p>
<p>Nearly 60 years later, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission returned from space with a sample of an asteroid named Bennu, similar to the one that rained rocks over Revelstoke. Our research team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08495-6">has published a chemical analysis</a> of those samples, providing insight into how some of the ingredients for life may have first arrived on Earth.</p>
<p>Born in the years bracketing the Revelstoke meteorite’s fall, the two of us have spent our careers in the meteorite collections of the <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/mineral-sciences/collections-overview">Smithsonian Institution</a> in Washington, DC, and the <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/services/collections/mineralogy/meteorites.html">Natural History Museum</a> in London.

              <![CDATA[<p>Tesla released its financial results for 2024 on Wednesday afternoon, following the close of the markets. The maker of electric vehicles may have to invest in stocks of red ink, because 2024 results were even less impressive than the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/tesla-publishes-its-financial-results-for-2023-profit-margin-shrinks/">already-underwhelming 2023 numbers</a>.</p>
<h2>Q4, 2024</h2>
<p>During the final quarter of last year, Tesla saw its automotive revenues fall by 8 percent compared to the same three months of 2023, dropping to $19.8 billion. It more than doubled its energy and storage revenues, which grew by 113 percent compared to Q4 2023, but this amounts to just $3 billion and a small fraction of Tesla's overall business. Similarly, services posted a 31 percent growth during those three months, but again the actual contribution in dollar terms was just $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>Total revenue grew by 2 percent in Q4, but income fell by 23 percent, and its operating margin has dropped to just 6.2 percent—the lowest since Q1 2024. By contrast, the industry average operating margin for an automaker is around 10 percent. Net profits fell an astounding 71 percent to $2.3 billion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/teslas-2024-financial-results-are-out-and-theyre-terrible/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Porsche provided flights from Daytona Beach to Valencia and accommodation so Ars could drive the new GT3. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>VALENCIA, SPAIN—A Porsche 911 is rather special compared to most "normal" cars. The rear-engined sports car might be bigger and less likely to swap ends than the 1960s version, but it remains one of the more nimble and engaging four-wheeled vehicles you can buy. The 911 comes in a multitude of variants, but among driving enthusiasts, few are better regarded than the GT3. And Porsche has just treated the current 911 GT3 to its midlife refresh, which it will build in regular and Touring flavors.</p>
<p>The GT3 is a 911 you can drive to the track, spend the day lapping, and drive home again. It's come a long way since the 1999 original—that car made less power than a base 911 does now. Now, the recipe is a bit more involved, with a naturally aspirated flat-six engine mounted behind the rear axle that generates 502 hp (375 kW) and 331 lb-ft (450 Nm) and a redline that doesn't interrupt play until 9,000 rpm. You'll need to exercise it to reach those outputs—peak power arrives at 8,500, although peak torque happens a bit sooner at around 6,000 revs.</p>
<p>It's a mighty engine indeed, derived from the racing version of the 911, with some tweaks for road legality. So there are things like individual throttle valves, dry sump lubrication, solid cam finger followers (instead of hydraulic valve lifters), titanium con rods, and forged pistons.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/01/weight-saving-and-aero-optimization-feature-in-the-2025-porsche-911-gt3/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) today proposed a law that would let copyright owners obtain court orders requiring Internet service providers to block access to foreign piracy websites. The bill would also force DNS providers to block sites.</p>
<p>Lofgren said in a <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-lofgren-introduces-targeted-legislation-combat-foreign-online-piracy">press release</a> that she "work[ed] for over a year with the tech, film, and television industries" on "a proposal that has a remedy for copyright infringers located overseas that does not disrupt the free Internet except for the infringers." Lofgren said she plans to work with Republican leaders to enact the bill.</p>
<p>Lofgren's press release includes a quote from Charles Rivkin, chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association (MPA). As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/movie-industry-demands-us-law-requiring-isps-to-block-piracy-websites/">previously written</a>, the MPA has been urging Congress to pass a site-blocking law.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/movie-industry-loves-bill-that-would-force-isps-to-block-piracy-websites/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When we developed the ability to convert various cells into a stem cell, it held the promise of an entirely new type of therapy. Rather than getting the body to try to fix itself with its cells or deal with the complications of organ transplants, we could convert a few adult cells to stem cells and induce them to form any tissue in the body. We could potentially repair or replace tissues with an effectively infinite supply of a patient's own cells.</p>
<p>Although the Nobel Prize for induced stem cells was handed out over a decade ago, the therapies have been slow to follow. In a new paper published in the journal Nature, however, a group of German researchers is now describing tests in primates of a method of repairing the heart using new muscle generated from stem cells. Although they're not yet providing everything that we might hope for, the results are promising. And they've been enough to start clinical trials, with similar results being seen in humans.</p>
<h2>Heart problems</h2>
<p>The heart contains a lot of specialized tissues, including those that form blood vessels or specialize in conducting electrical signals. But the key to the heart is a form of specialized muscle cell, called a cardiomyocyte. Once the heart matures, the cardiomyocytes stop dividing, meaning that you end up with a fixed population. Any damage to the heart due to injury or infection does not get repaired, meaning damage will be cumulative.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/stem-cells-used-to-partially-repair-damaged-hearts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are scheduled to don spacesuits to exit the International Space Station. However, despite a plea from President Trump to bring them home as soon as possible, the pair won't be coming home just yet. This will be a routine spacewalk outside the space station.</p>
<p>In the meantime, NASA is struggling to contain the fallout from what appears to be a disingenuous political effort by Trump to shame the space agency and Biden administration for the fact that Williams and Wilmore, nearly eight months after they launched into orbit on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, are still there.</p>
<p>The brouhaha began on Tuesday evening when SpaceX founder and Trump confidant Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884365928038563880">posted on X</a> that the president had asked SpaceX to bring the two "stranded" astronauts back to Earth. Musk added that SpaceX would do so, and, "Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/the-long-planned-return-of-two-astronauts-from-space-is-now-a-political-issue/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration today withdrew a controversial order to freeze funding for a wide range of government programs, according to multiple news reports. Acting Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Matthew Vaeth <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-rescinds-funding-freeze-directive-memo-shows/story?id=118229342">reportedly</a> wrote in today's memo, "OMB Memorandum M-25-13 is rescinded. If you have questions about implementing the President's Executive Orders, please contact your agency General Counsel."</p>
<p>A federal judge yesterday temporarily blocked the funding freeze with an administrative stay that lasts until February 3 and scheduled a hearing for February 3 to decide whether to block the freeze for longer. States were already having <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/states-say-theyve-been-shut-out-of-medicaid-amid-trump-funding-freeze/">trouble accessing Medicaid</a> after the Monday order, and the future of many <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/">other programs</a> has been in doubt.</p>
<p>A $42.45 billion broadband deployment program that has been in the works for years seemed to be threatened by the now-rescinded funding freeze and could undergo changes even though the freeze was rescinded today. The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program was created by Congress in November 2021 and is being implemented by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-admin-rescinds-controversial-funding-freeze-after-two-days-of-protest/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We usually think of robots as being made out of hard, rigid materials, but soft robotics seeks to build robotic devices out of more flexible materials that mimic the properties of those found in living animals. Case in point: Korean engineers have built soft robots capable of rapid and powerful joint movements by employing the same mechanism that gives the mantis shrimp such a powerful punch, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.ado7696">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Robotics.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/when-the-medium-matters-the-mighty-mantis-shrimp-pulls-its-punch-in-air/">we've reported</a> previously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp">mantis shrimp</a> come in many different varieties; there are some 450 known species. But they can generally be grouped into two types: those that stab their prey with spear-like appendages ("spearers") and those that smash their prey ("smashers") with large, rounded, and hammer-like claws ("raptorial appendages"). Those strikes are so fast (as much as 23 meters per second, or 51 mph) and powerful, they often produce cavitation bubbles in the water, creating a shock wave that can serve as a follow-up strike, stunning and sometimes killing the prey. Sometimes a strike can even produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence">sonoluminescence</a>, whereby the cavitation bubbles produce a brief flash of light as they collapse.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(18)30134-2">a 2018 study</a>, the secret to that powerful punch seems to arise not from bulky muscles but from the spring-loaded anatomical structure of the shrimp's arms, akin to a bow and arrow or a mousetrap. The shrimp's muscles pull on a saddle-shaped structure in the arm, causing it to bend and store potential energy, which is released with the swinging of the club-like claw. It's essentially a latch-like mechanism (technically, Latch-mediated spring actuation, or LaMSA), with small structures in the muscle tendons called sclerites serving as the latch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/this-mantis-shrimp-inspired-robotic-arm-can-crack-an-egg/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Sony's game publishing arm has done a 180-degree turn on a controversial policy of requiring PC players to sign in with PlayStation accounts for some games, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">according to a blog post</a> by the company.</p>
<p>A PlayStation account will "become optional" for <em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>, and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>. Sony hasn't lost hope that players will still go ahead and use a PlayStation account, though, as it's tying several benefits to signing in.</p>
<p>Logging in with PlayStation will be required to access trophies, the PlayStation equivalent of achievements. (Steam achievements appear to be supported regardless.) It will also allow friend management, provided you have social contacts on the PlayStation Network.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/sony-removes-playstation-account-requirement-from-4-single-player-steam-games/">Read full article</a></p>
