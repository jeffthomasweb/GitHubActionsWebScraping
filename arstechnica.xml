                            <![CDATA[<p>Six weeks after he terminated the nomination of Jared Isaacman to become NASA Administrator, President Trump moved on Wednesday evening to install a new temporary leader for the space agency.</p>
<p>The newly named interim administrator, Sean Duffy, already has a full portfolio: He is serving as the Secretary of Transportation, a Cabinet-level position that oversees 55,000 employees at thirteen agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>"Sean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country's Transportation Affairs, including creating a state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient, and beautiful, again," Trump wrote on his social media network Wednesday evening. "He will be a fantastic leader of the ever more important Space Agency, even if only for a short period of time."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/nasa-has-a-new-interim-administrator-the-secretary-of-transportation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, sheet music platform Soundslice <a href="https://www.holovaty.com/writing/chatgpt-fake-feature/">says</a> it developed a <a href="https://www.soundslice.com/help/en/creating/importing/331/ascii-tab/">new feature</a> after discovering that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> was incorrectly telling users the service could import <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_tab">ASCII tablature</a>—a text-based guitar notation format the company had never supported. The incident reportedly marks what might be the first case of a business building functionality in direct response to an AI model's confabulation.</p>
<p>Typically, Soundslice digitizes sheet music from photos or PDFs and syncs the notation with audio or video recordings, allowing musicians to see the music scroll by as they hear it played. The platform also includes tools for slowing down playback and practicing difficult passages.</p>
<p>Adrian Holovaty, co-founder of <a href="https://www.soundslice.com/">Soundslice</a>, wrote in a recent blog post that the recent feature development process began as a complete mystery. A few months ago, Holovaty began noticing unusual activity in the company's error logs. Instead of typical sheet music uploads, users were submitting screenshots of ChatGPT conversations containing ASCII tablature—simple text representations of guitar music that look like strings with numbers indicating fret positions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/chatgpt-made-up-a-product-feature-out-of-thin-air-so-this-company-created-it/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In particular, website owners and SEO experts wanted to know how Cloudflare planned to block Google's bot from scraping sites to fuel AI overviews without risking blocking the same bot from crawling for valuable search engine placements.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple hasn't iterated on its Vision Pro hardware since launching it in early 2024 for $3,499, opting instead to refine the headset with a steady stream of software updates. But Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/apple-readies-first-upgrade-to-its-struggling-vision-pro-headset">reports</a> that a new version of the Vision Pro could arrive "as early as this year," with a replacement for the 3-year-old Apple M2 chip and a more comfortable strap.</p>
<p>Gurman says that the updated Vision Pro would ship with Apple's M4 processor, which launched in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/m4-ipad-pro-review-well-now-youre-just-showing-off/">the iPad Pro</a> last year and has since found its way into new MacBook Pros, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-m4-macbook-air-review-i-have-no-notes/">MacBook Airs</a>, a new iMac, and a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/review-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-are-probably-apples-best-mac-minis-ever/">redesigned Mac mini</a>.</p>
<p>Our tests in Apple's other devices (and publicly available benchmark databases like <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">Geekbench's</a>) show the M4 offering roughly 50 percent better multicore CPU performance and 20 or 25 percent better graphics performance than the M2, respectable increases for a device like the Vision Pro that needs to draw high-resolution images with as little latency as possible. Improvements to the chip's video encoding and decoding hardware and image signal processor should also provide small-but-noticeable improvements to the headset's passthrough video feed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/report-apple-m4-more-comfortable-strap-will-headline-first-major-vision-pro-update/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Extensions installed on almost 1 million devices have been overriding key security protections to turn browsers into engines that scrape websites on behalf of a paid service, a researcher said.</p>
<p>The 245 extensions, available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, have racked up nearly 909,000 downloads, John Tuckner of SecurityAnnex <a href="https://secureannex.com/blog/mellow-drama/">reported</a>. The extensions serve a wide range of purposes, including managing bookmarks and clipboards, boosting speaker volumes, and generating random numbers. The common thread among all of them: They incorporate <a href="https://github.com/mellowtel-inc/mellowtel-js">MellowTel-js</a>, an open source JavaScript library that allows developers to monetize their extensions.</p>
<h2>Intentional weakening of browsing protections</h2>
<p>Tuckner and critics say the monetization works by using the browser extensions to scrape websites on behalf of paying customers, which include advertisers. Tuckner reached this conclusion after uncovering close ties between MellowTel and <a href="https://www.olostep.com/">Olostep</a>, a company that bills itself as "the world's most reliable and cost-effective Web scraping API." Olostep says its service “avoids all bot detection and can parallelize up to 100K requests in minutes.” Paying customers submit the locations of browsers they want to access specific webpages. Olostep then uses its installed base of extension users to fulfill the request.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/browser-extensions-turn-nearly-1-million-browsers-into-website-scraping-bots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>Washington, DC—</em>From a distance, the gathering looked like a standard poster session at an academic conference, with researchers standing next to large displays of the work they were doing. Except in this case, it was taking place in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill, and the researchers were describing work that they <em>weren’t</em> doing. Called "The things we’ll never know," the event was meant to highlight the work of researchers whose grants had been canceled by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>A lot of court cases <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/harvard-sues-to-block-government-funding-cuts/">have been dealing</a> with these cancellations as a group, highlighting the lack of scientific—or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/doge-told-the-nih-which-grants-to-cancel-with-no-scientific-review/">seemingly rational</a>—input into the decisions to cut funding for entire categories of research. Here, there was a much tighter focus on the individual pieces of research that had become casualties in that larger fight.</p>
<p>Seeing even a small sampling of the individual grants that have been terminated provides a much better perspective on the sort of damage that is being done to the US public by these cuts and the utter mindlessness of the process that's causing that damage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/things-well-never-know-science-fair-highlights-us-canceled-research/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>With Verizon seeking permission to lock phones to its network for six months or longer instead of the current 60 days, a coalition of advocacy groups yesterday urged the Federal Communications Commission to reject the cellular carrier's petition.</p>
<p>"Phone locking distorts market competition, raises switching costs, and contributes to unnecessary e-waste," the groups said in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10707301106032/1">filing</a>. "It impedes consumers' ability to take full advantage of the devices they already own, forces them to purchase new phones unnecessarily, and reduces their freedom to choose more affordable or higher-quality service options. It undermines price discipline among carriers, makes it harder for smaller and prepaid-focused providers to compete, and reduces the availability of high-quality used devices on the secondary market."</p>
<p>The FCC filing was submitted by Public Knowledge, the Benton Foundation, the Canadian Repair Coalition, Consumer Reports, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Fight for the Future, iFixit, the Fulu Foundation, the Open Technology Institute at New America, law professor Aaron Perzanowski, Repair.org, and the Software Freedom Conservancy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/verizons-request-to-lock-phones-supported-by-police-opposed-by-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company in history to reach $4 trillion market valuation as shares rose more than 2 percent, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/09/nvidia-hits-4-trillion-market-cap-first-company-to-do-so.html">reports CNBC</a>. The GPU maker's stock has climbed 22 percent since the start of 2025, continuing a trend driven by demand for AI hardware following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT's late 2022 launch</a>.</p>
<p>The milestone marks the highest market cap ever recorded for a publicly traded company, surpassing Apple's <a href="https://www.voronoiapp.com/markets/-Apple-Surpasses-3-of-Global-Market-Cap-in-December-2024-3434">previous record</a> of $3.8 trillion set in December. Nvidia first crossed $2 trillion in February 2024 and reached $3 trillion just four months later in June. The $4 trillion valuation represents a market capitalization larger than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)">the GDP of most countries</a>.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/nvidia-thinks-ai-boom-is-far-from-over-as-gpu-sales-drive-big-earnings-win/">explained in 2023</a>, Nvidia's continued success has been intimately tied to growth in demand for hardware that runs AI models as capably and efficiently as possible. The company's data center GPUs excel at performing billions of matrix multiplications necessary to train and run neural networks due to their parallel architecture—hardware architectures that originated as video game graphics accelerators now power the generative AI boom.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/ai-mania-pushes-nvidia-to-record-4-trillion-valuation/">Read full article</a></p>

      Pugsly joins his big sister at Nevermore in <em>Wednesday</em> S2.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The Netflix series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday_(TV_series)"><em>Wednesday</em></a>, created by Tim Burton, was one of our favorites <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/tv-technica-2022-these-were-our-favorite-shows-and-binges-of-the-year/">in 2022</a>, and while it was quickly renewed, it's been a long wait for that second season. That wait is nearly over. The first half of S2 debuts next month, and Netflix has released a full-length trailer to remind us of that fact. Verdict: It looks like we're in for another spooky supernatural mystery that only our favorite pig-tailed goth girl detective can solve, with all the deadpan witticisms and lavish Burton-esque aesthetics one could hope for.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/wednesday-s2-teaser-promises-more-spooky-delights/">previously reported</a>, the first season followed Wednesday's (Jenna Ortega) adventures as a new student at Nevermore Academy. Aloof, sardonic, and resolutely independent, she was very much the problem child, even by Addams standards, having been expelled from eight schools in five years. Hence, her enrollment at Nevermore, a haven for so-called "outcasts" and the alma mater of her parents.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/dark-visions-and-monsters-abound-in-wednesday-s2-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There's no denying annual smartphone releases have settled into a routine—flat glass slabs with slightly faster processors and better cameras. Foldable phones buck the trend, but these products come with plenty of drawbacks. They're big and heavy, and even with all that bulk, the battery life and cameras can be lacking.</p>
<p>Samsung's new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 don't right all the wrongs, but they mark the most significant year-to-year upgrade since the company began making foldables. The new phones are thinner and lighter, particularly in the case of the Z Fold 7, which is even lighter than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. You will pay handsomely for Samsung's new foldable flagship, but it's also releasing a new budget FE version of its flip phone as well.</p>
<h2>One big fold</h2>
<p>Samsung has been making foldable phones longer than anyone, but the changes from one generation to the next have been minimal. Its seventh-generation foldables make the biggest leap yet, responding to a new spate of thinner foldables from Google, Oppo, and others. That's really the biggest innovation for the Galaxy Z Fold 7—it's slimmer and a bit wider.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/samsungs-7th-gen-foldables-slim-down-may-finally-fit-in-your-pocket/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Volvo was among the very first of the global automakers to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/07/volvo-says-from-2019-all-new-models-it-introduces-will-be-electric-or-hybrid/">declare plans</a> to build an all-electrified future. Note the choice of word—electrified, not electric, as it includes hybrids, both plug-in and mild. When it comes to pure electric vehicles, the Swedish automaker has something of a two-pronged strategy. At the low end, there's the diminutive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/driving-the-volvo-ex30-a-36k-ev-that-prioritizes-sustainability/">EX30</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/volvo-added-plenty-of-charm-to-the-ex30-cross-country-ev/">EX30 Cross Country</a>, a pair of stripped-down crossovers whose value proposition might be entirely different in light of tariffs and the end of the clean vehicle tax credit. At the other end of the spectrum is the EX90, a big battery electric SUV with tech so cutting-edge that some of it wasn't even ready when we had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/ex90review/">our first drive</a> last fall.</p>
<p>The idea of a high-end Volvo is not a new one; for decades, the company has offered a low-key luxury alternative to the flashier German brands. It's just that back then, your family doctor probably drove a Volvo station wagon, whereas these days, most people want something with a little more height. Unlike the little EX30s, the EX90 should be largely unaffected by the recent chaos—it's built in South Carolina, so it isn't subject to import tariffs (beyond any imported parts used to build it) and with a starting price of $81,290, it's just too expensive to qualify for the IRS 30D tax credit, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/gop-wants-ev-tax-credit-gone-it-would-be-a-disaster-for-tesla/">now goes away</a> at the end of September.</p>
<p>Do Volvo's impeccable safety credentials and the EX90's emissions-free powertrain purchase it any credit in the war on cars? Probably not, but there's something wonderfully incongruous about the slab sides and beige paint (actually a solid metallic called Sand Dune) accented by the bright jewelry of the daylight running lights, although the lidar hump on the roof continues to scream "London taxi cab" at me. (Did you know that Volvo's corporate parent also owns a company that builds <a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/what-an-electric-london-taxi-is-like-to-drive-1828352397/">those</a>?) As you approach the car and it unlocks, the "Thor's Hammer" headlights do a neat little mechanical "blink"—think that one alien that Will Smith chased around the Guggenheim in <em>Men in Black</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-volvo-ex90-a-low-key-luxury-electric-suv/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The prototype gateway was able to connect with several satellites in space during recent testing, said Bridgit Mendler, co-founder and chief executive of Northwood Space. This successful demonstration has given Northwood confidence to move into commercial deployment of the company's antennas within the coming months.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The European Space Agency has selected five launch startups to become eligible for up to 169 million euros ($198 million) in funding to develop alternatives to Arianespace, the continent's incumbent launch service provider.</p>
<p>The five companies ESA selected are Isar Aerospace, MaiaSpace, Rocket Factory Augsburg, PLD Space, and Orbex. Only one of these companies, Isar Aerospace, has attempted to launch a rocket into orbit. Isar's Spectrum rocket <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/europes-first-private-launch-company-is-learning-to-embrace-failure/">failed moments after liftoff</a> from Norway on a test flight in March.</p>
<p>None of these companies is guaranteed an ESA contract or funding. Over the next several months, the European Space Agency and the five launch companies will negotiate with European governments for funding leading up to ESA's ministerial council meeting in November, when ESA member states will set the agency's budget for at least the next two years. Only then will ESA be ready to sign binding agreements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/sizing-up-the-5-companies-selected-for-europes-launcher-challenge/">Read full article</a></p>

But in June 2023, as wildfire smoke from Canada spread, the air quality dropped to historically low levels in her home state of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Just last month, the region’s air quality dipped once more to unhealthy levels. Again, wildfires were to blame.</p>
<p>While the US has made significant strides in curbing car and industrial pollution through setting emission limits on industrial facilities and automakers, the increasing frequency and intensity of fires are “erasing the gains that we have obtained through this pollutant control effort,” said Nga Lee “Sally” Ng, an aerosol researcher at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/wildfires-are-challenging-air-quality-monitoring-infrastructure/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A critical vulnerability allowing hackers to bypass multifactor authentication in network management devices made by Citrix has been actively exploited for more than a month, researchers said. The finding is at odds with advisories from the vendor saying there is no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation.</p>
<p>Tracked as CVE-2025-5777, the vulnerability shares similarities with CVE-2023-4966, a security flaw nicknamed CitrixBleed, which led to the compromise of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/critical-citrix-bleed-vulnerability-allowing-mfa-bypass-comes-under-mass-exploitation/">20,000 Citrix devices</a> two years ago. The list of Citrix customers hacked in the CitrixBleed exploitation spree included Boeing, Australian shipping company DP World, Commercial Bank of China, and the Allen &amp; Overy law firm. A Comcast network was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/hack-of-unpatched-comcast-servers-results-in-stolen-personal-data-including-passwords/">also breached</a>, allowing threat actors to steal password data and other sensitive information belonging to 36 million Xfinity customers.</p>
<h2>Giving attackers a head start</h2>
<p>Both CVE-2025-5777 and CVE-2023-4966 reside in Citrix’s NetScaler Application Delivery Controller and NetScaler Gateway, which provide load balancing and single sign-on in enterprise networks, respectively. The vulnerability causes vulnerable devices to leak—or “bleed”—small chunks of memory contents after receiving modified requests sent over the Internet.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/critical-citrixbleed-2-vulnerability-has-been-under-active-exploit-for-weeks/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Part of the fun of 3D printing is discovering just how many possibilities there are for different things to print. Obviously, they're fun for printing toys or decorations that you couldn't or wouldn't buy yourself, but they're also powerful problem-solving tools. Once you've solved a few problems with 3D printed parts, you start looking around for other minor inconveniences or quality-of-life upgrades that you could solve—and the breadth and depth of the 3D printing community means that you can almost always find someone else who has already thought up and posted a solution for you.</p>
<p>As a coda to our series about breaking into 3D printing for the first time, the 3D printer-pilled among the Ars staff is sharing a few of their favorite unexpected prints, from fun all-purpose gifts to containers and organizers to parts that will help you with your other, non-3D-printing-related hobbies. This is just a fraction of what's out there, but if you're still on the fence, maybe some of these will open your mind to the possibilities.</p>
<h2>Coffee gear</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Every morning, I make either a pour-over coffee or some form of espresso. For measuring my beans, I printed two </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1462163-the-ultimate-coffee-bean-dosing-cup?from=search#profileId-1524716">dosing cups</a>.<span style="font-size: 16px;"> The black one is matte black PLA with a fuzzy surface texture (an option in most slicers that adds random noise to the outside wall paths), and the white one is ABS that I sanded to a smooth surface. For sanding, I prefer ABS, as it’s easier to get something that has no real signs of layer lines. </span>To tamp my espresso grounds, I printed a handle in black ABS and sanded it smooth to feel good in the hand. The rounded knob helps me get pressure more comfortably than the raw metal of the original tamper, and the radial fins fit perfectly into the dosing cup, keeping the tamp straight up and down so I don’t end up with a sloped surface.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/intro-to-3d-printing-part-3-the-cool-weird-and-unexpected-prints-we-love/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal appeals court today struck down a "click-to-cancel" rule that would have required companies to make cancelling services as easy as signing up. The Federal Trade Commission rule was scheduled to take effect on July 14 but was vacated by the US Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel ruled unanimously that the Biden-era FTC, then led by Chair Lina Khan, failed to follow the full rulemaking process required under US law. "While we certainly do not endorse the use of unfair and deceptive practices in negative option marketing, the procedural deficiencies of the Commission's rulemaking process are fatal here," the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca8.110200/gov.uscourts.ca8.110200.00805299737.3.pdf">ruling</a> said.</p>
<p>Indicating their sympathy with the FTC's motivations, judges wrote that many Americans "have found themselves unwittingly enrolled in recurring subscription plans, continuing to pay for unwanted products or services because they neglected to cancel their subscriptions." Last year, the FTC updated its 1973 Negative Option Rule by "adding provisions that bar sellers from misrepresenting material facts and require disclosure of material terms, express consumer consent, and a simple cancellation mechanism," the ruling said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/us-court-cancels-ftc-rule-that-would-have-made-canceling-subscriptions-easier/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After US health secretary and hardline anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-fires-entire-cdc-panel-of-vaccine-advisors/">fired all 17 highly respected vaccine experts</a> from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) last month, he vetted their replacements, not by medical and scientific expertise, but by their political leanings, according to a<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.286605/gov.uscourts.mad.286605.1.0.pdf"> lawsuit filed by medical organizations Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Under Kennedy, to qualify to be on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's nationally influential and historically apolitical ACIP, candidates had to be registered as a Republican or independent and could not have any history of publicly criticizing President Trump or Kennedy, the lawsuit claims.</p>
<p>Just two days after dismissing all 17 ACIP members—who had all gone through an extensive vetting process that lasted up to two years—Kennedy announced eight new members. One later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel.html">dropped out during last-minute financial vetting</a> the day before an ACIP meeting.
