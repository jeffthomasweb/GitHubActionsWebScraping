<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>We’ve been living through the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-generative-ai-revolution-has-begun-how-did-we-get-here/">generative AI boom</a> for nearly a year and a half now, following the late 2022 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But despite transformative effects on companies’ share prices, generative AI tools powered by large language models (LLMs) still have major drawbacks that have kept them from being as useful as many would like them to be. Retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, aims to fix some of those drawbacks.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most prominent drawback of LLMs is their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">tendency toward confabulation</a> (also called “hallucination”), which is a creative gap-filling technique AI language models use when they encounter holes in their knowledge that weren’t present in their training data. They generate plausible-sounding text that can veer toward accuracy when the training data is solid but otherwise may just be completely made up.</p>
<p>Relying on confabulating AI models gets people and companies in trouble, as we’ve covered in the past. In 2023, we saw <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/michael-cohens-lawyer-cited-three-fake-cases-in-possible-ai-fueled-screwup/">two instances</a> of lawyers citing legal cases, confabulated by AI, that didn’t exist. We’ve covered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/will-chatgpts-hallucinations-be-allowed-to-ruin-your-life/">claims against OpenAI</a> in which ChatGPT confabulated and accused innocent people of doing terrible things. In February, we wrote about Air Canada’s customer service chatbot <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/">inventing a refund policy</a>, and in March, a New York City chatbot was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/nycs-government-chatbot-is-lying-about-city-laws-and-regulations/">caught confabulating</a> city regulations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028618#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028618&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After years of delays, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft finally rocketed into orbit from Florida on Wednesday, sending two veteran NASA astronauts on a long-delayed shakedown cruise to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The Starliner capsule lifted off at 10:52 am EDT (14:52 UTC) on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Fifteen minutes later, after shedding two strap-on boosters and a core stage powered by a Russian RD-180 engine, the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage released Starliner right on target to begin a nearly 26-hour pursuit of the space station. Docking at the space station is set for 12:15 pm EDT (16:15 UTC) Thursday, where NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will spend at least a week before coming back to Earth.</p>
<p>In remarks shortly after Wednesday's launch, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wilmore and Williams, both former US Navy pilots, will "test this thing from izzard to gizzard" to ensure Boeing's Starliner is ready for operational six-month crew rotation missions to the ISS.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029190#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029190&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has bluntly stated the truth: "<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html">Vaccines do not cause autism</a>," the agency affirms on its website. Yet, nearly a quarter of Americans still don't believe it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/false-belief-in-mmr-vaccine-autism-link-endures-as-measles-threat-persists/">an April 2024 survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center</a> (APPC) of the University of Pennsylvania, 24 percent of US adults denied or disputed that the CDC ever said that. Specifically, the survey asked them to assess the accuracy of the statement that the CDC has said there is no evidence linking vaccines to autism. Six percent called the statement "very inaccurate," and 18 percent said it was "somewhat inaccurate." An additional 3 percent responded that they were "not sure." Of the remaining 73 percent, only 41 percent considered it "very accurate," and 32 percent said it was "somewhat accurate."</p>
<p>The results are largely unchanged from responses in 2018 when survey respondents were asked the same question. In that year, 26 percent of adults reported that the statement was "very inaccurate" or "somewhat inaccurate."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029345#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029345&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last year, a feature-length documentary purportedly produced by Netflix began circulating on Telegram. Titled “Olympics have Fallen” and narrated by a voice with a striking similarity to that of actor Tom Cruise, it sharply criticized the leadership of the International Olympic Committee. The slickly produced film, claiming five-star reviews from the New York Times, Washington Post, and BBC, was quickly amplified on social media. Among those seemingly endorsing the documentary were celebrities on the platform <a href="https://www.cameo.com/">Cameo</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/MTAC_Report_Russian_Influence_and_Paris_2024.pdf">recently published report by Microsoft</a> (PDF) said the film was not a documentary, had received no such reviews, and that the narrator's voice was an AI-produced deep fake of Cruise. It also said the endorsements on Cameo were faked. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report went on to say that the fraudulent documentary and endorsements were only one of many elaborate hoaxes created by agents of the Russian government in a year-long influence operation intended to discredit the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and deter participation and attendance at the Paris Olympics starting next month.</p>
<p>Other examples of the Kremlin’s ongoing influence operation include:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029315#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029315&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>T-Mobile is hoping that home Internet customers who suffer from frequent service outages will pay $30 a month for a "backup" 5G plan. T-Mobile's new "Home Internet Backup," <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/home-internet-backup">announced</a> today, is intended to be used only when a user's primary home Internet service goes down.</p>
<p>One big drawback is that T-Mobile clearly intends for customers to subscribe to the $30 monthly plan indefinitely, even though a user likely wouldn't need it during some months and might need it for just a day or two in other months. The pricing terms make it so that canceling and resubscribing as needed is not feasible.</p>
<p>T-Mobile said the plan provides 130GB of 5G data each month, "enough to keep a typical household connected with Wi-Fi for up to seven days a month when their primary internet service goes down." After 130GB, speeds will be reduced to "up to" 600kbps.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029297#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029297&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After the most downloaded local news app in the US, NewsBreak, shared an AI-generated story about a fake New Jersey shooting last Christmas Eve, New Jersey police had to post a statement online to reassure troubled citizens that the story was "entirely false," Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/top-news-app-us-has-chinese-origins-writes-fiction-with-help-ai-2024-06-05/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>"Nothing even similar to this story occurred on or around Christmas, or even in recent memory for the area they described," the cops' Facebook post said. "It seems this 'news' outlet's AI writes fiction they have no problem publishing to readers."</p>
<p>It took NewsBreak—which attracts over 50 million monthly users—four days to remove the fake shooting story, and it apparently wasn't an isolated incident. According to Reuters, NewsBreak's AI tool, which scrapes the web and helps rewrite local news stories, has been used to publish at least 40 misleading or erroneous stories since 2021.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029287#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029287&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As we’re currently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/ai-marketing-hype-is-coming-for-your-favorite-gadgets/">seeing with AI</a>, when a new technology becomes buzzy, companies will do almost anything to cram that tech into their products. Trends fade, however, and corporate priorities shift—resulting in bricked gadgets and buyer's remorse.</p>
<p>That’s what's happening to some who bought into Oral-B toothbrushes with Amazon Alexa built in. Oral-B released the Guide for $230 in August 2020 but bricked the ability to set up or reconfigure Alexa on the product this February. As of this writing, the Guide is still available through a third-party Amazon seller.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Roughly a year ago, astronomers announced that they had observed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/new-slow-repeating-radio-source-we-have-no-idea-what-it-is/">an object that shouldn't exist</a>. Like a pulsar, it emitted regularly timed bursts of radio emissions. But unlike a pulsar, those bursts were separated by over 20 minutes. If the 22-minute gap between bursts represents the rotation period of the object, then it is rotating too slowly to produce radio emissions by any known mechanism.</p>
<p>Now, some of the same team (along with new collaborators) are back with the discovery of something that, if anything, is acting even more oddly. The new source of radio bursts, ASKAP J193505.1+214841.0, takes nearly an hour between bursts. And it appears to have three different settings, sometimes producing weaker bursts and sometimes skipping them entirely. While the researchers suspect that, like pulsars, this is also powered by a neutron star, it's not even clear that it's the same class of object as their earlier discovery.</p>
<h2>How pulsars pulse</h2>
<p>Contrary to the section heading, pulsars don't actually pulse. Neutron stars can create the illusion by having magnetic poles that aren't lined up with their rotational pole. The magnetic poles are a source of constant radio emissions, but as the neutron star rotates, the emissions from the magnetic pole sweep across space in a manner similar to the light from a rotating lighthouse. If Earth happens to be caught up in that sweep, then the neutron star will appear to blink on and off as it rotates.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029258#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029258&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Motorola's newest phone is the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-motorola-edge-gen-5/p">Motorola Edge 2024</a>. This is a mid-range phone with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2. It costs $550 and will be in stores June 20. Every Motorola phone nowadays <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/the-2024-moto-g-stylus-is-a-400-mid-ranger-with-vegan-leather/">looks</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-2024-moto-g-power-packs-wireless-charging-8gb-ram-in-a-300-phone/">exactly</a> <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-g-play-gen-3/p?skuId=1041">the same</a>, but Motorola assures us this is new.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 is the bottom of Qualcomm's "7 series" lineup and features four Cortex-A78 cores and four Cortex-A55 cores built on a 4 nm manufacturing process. The phone has a 144 Hz, 6.6-inch 2400×1080 OLED panel with curved sides. It has 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 5000 mAh battery, 68 W wired charging, and 15 W wireless charging. Cameras include a mid-range 50 MP Sony "<a href="https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/info/2023/2023061501.html">LYTIA</a>" 700C, 13 MP wide-angle, and a 32 MP front camera. The phone has NFC, Wi-Fi 6E, an in-screen fingerprint reader, and—a big addition compared to other Motorola devices—an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>Just like on the Moto G Stylus, this phone has a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/the-2024-moto-g-stylus-is-a-400-mid-ranger-with-vegan-leather/">vegan leather</a>" back option that should be softer than the usual plastic, but it's still plastic. Unlike that phone, there's no headphone jack or MicroSD slot. A customizable hardware button on the left side of the phone lets you open the Google Assistant or whatever other app you choose.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029197#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029197&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A couple of weekends ago, when most of the world's motorsport attention was focused on Monaco and Indianapolis, Toyota President Akio "Morizo" Toyoda was taking part in the Super Taikyu Fuji 24 Hours at Fuji Speedway in Japan. Automotive executives racing their own products is not exactly unheard of, but few instances have been quite as unexpected as competing in endurance races with a hydrogen-burning Corolla.</p>
<p>A hydrogen-powered Toyota has shown up for the past few years, in fact, as the company uses the race track to learn new things about thermal efficiency that it says have benefitted its latest generation of internal-combustion engines, which it debuted to the public at the end of May.</p>
<p>With backing from its government, the Japanese auto industry has continued to explore hydrogen as an alternative vehicle energy source instead of liquid hydrocarbons or batteries. Commercially, that's been in the form of hydrogen fuel cells, although with very little success among drivers, even in areas that have some hydrogen fueling infrastructure.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029224#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029224&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Canada has ordered large online streaming services to pay 5 percent of their Canadian revenue to the government in a program expected to raise $200 million per year to support local news and other home-grown content. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/radio-television-telecommunications/news/2024/06/crtc-requires-online-streaming-services-to-contribute-to-canadas-broadcasting-system.html">announced</a> its decision yesterday after a public comment period.</p>
<p>"Based on the public record, the CRTC is requiring online streaming services to contribute 5 percent of their Canadian revenues to support the Canadian broadcasting system. These obligations will start in the 2024–2025 broadcast year and will provide an estimated $200 million per year in new funding," the regulator said.</p>
<p>The fees apply to both video and music streaming services. The CRTC imposed the rules despite opposition from Amazon, Apple, Disney, Google, Netflix, Paramount, and Spotify.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029192#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029192&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Australia's safety regulator has ended <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/elon-musks-x-dodges-australian-order-to-remove-church-stabbing-video/">a legal battle with X</a> (formerly Twitter) after threatening approximately $500,000 daily fines for failing to remove 65 instances of a religiously motivated stabbing video from X globally.</p>
<p>Enforcing Australia's Online Safety Act, eSafety commissioner Julie Inman-Grant had argued it would be dangerous for the videos to keep spreading on X, potentially inciting other acts of terror in Australia.</p>
<p>But X owner Elon Musk refused to comply with the global takedown order, arguing that it would be "unlawful and dangerous" to allow one country to control the global Internet. And Musk was not alone in this fight. The legal director of a nonprofit digital rights group called the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Corynne McSherry, backed up Musk, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/no-country-should-be-making-speech-rules-world">urging</a> the court to agree that "no single country should be able to restrict speech across the entire Internet."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029167#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029167&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 4,000-year-old skull and mandible of an Egyptian man show signs of cancerous lesions and tool marks, according to a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2024.1371645/full">recent paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. Those marks could be signs that someone tried to operate on the man shortly before his death or performed the ancient Egyptian equivalent of an autopsy to learn more about the cancer after death.</p>
<p>“This finding is unique evidence of how ancient Egyptian medicine would have tried to deal with or explore cancer more than 4,000 years ago,” <a href="https://frontiersin.org/news/2024/05/29/4000-year-old-egyptian-skull-cutmarks-cancer">said co-author Edgard Camarós</a>, a paleopathologist at the University of Santiago de Compostela. “This is an extraordinary new perspective in our understanding of the history of medicine.”</p>

For instance, in 2022, archaeologists excavated a 5,300-year-old skull of an elderly woman (about 65 years old) from a Spanish tomb. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-5300-year-old-skull-shows-evidence-of-the-earliest-known-ear-surgery/">They determined</a> that seven cut marks near the left ear canal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06223-6.pdf?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=e52d4fa5ac9c11ed82a9e06b0a82b824" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06223-6.pdf?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=e52d4fa5ac9c11ed82a9e06b0a82b824" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1717509048208ehc" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1717509048208ehc">were strong evidence</a> of a primitive surgical procedure to treat a middle ear infection. The team also identified a flint blade that may have been used as a cauterizing tool. By the 17th century, this was a fairly common procedure to treat acute ear infections, and skulls showing evidence of a mastoidectomy have been found in Croatia (11th century), Italy (18th and 19th centuries), and Copenhagen (19th or early 20th century). </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025113#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025113&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In October 2025, Microsoft will stop supporting Windows 10 for most PC users, which means no more technical support and (crucially) no more security updates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/post-2025-windows-10-updates-for-businesses-start-at-61-per-pc-go-up-from-there/">unless you decide to pay for them</a>. To encourage adoption, the vast majority of new Windows development is happening in Windows 11, which will get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/biggest-windows-11-update-in-2-years-nearly-finalized-enters-release-preview/">one of its biggest updates since release</a> sometime this fall.</p>

<p>But Windows 10 is casting a long shadow. It remains the most-used version of Windows by all publicly available metrics, including <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide">Statcounter</a> (where Windows 11's growth has been largely stagnant all year) and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam Hardware Survey</a>. And last November, Microsoft decided to release a fairly major batch of Windows 10 updates that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/microsoft-is-revisiting-windows-10-by-backporting-the-copilot-ai-assistant/">introduced the Copilot chatbot</a> and other changes to the aging operating system.</p>
<p>That may not be the end of the road. Microsoft has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/06/04/opening-the-beta-channel-for-windows-insiders-on-windows-10/">announced</a> that it is reopening a Windows Insider Beta Channel for PCs still running Windows 10, which will be used to test "new features and more improvements to Windows 10 as needed." Users can opt into the Windows 10 Beta Channel regardless of whether their PC meets the requirements for Windows 11; if your PC is compatible, signing up for the less-stable Dev or Canary channels will still upgrade your PC to Windows 11.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029081#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029081&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fresh off repairs at the launch pad in Florida, United Launch Alliance engineers restarted the countdown overnight for the third attempt to send an Atlas V rocket and Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on a test flight to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were expected to awake early Wednesday, put on their blue pressure suits, and head to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to board the Starliner capsule on top of the 172-foot-tall Atlas V rocket.</p>
<h2>Once more through the door</h2>
<p>Wilmore and Williams have done this twice before in hopes of launching into space on the first crew flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. A faulty valve on the Atlas V rocket prevented liftoff May 6, then engineers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/nasa-and-boeing-are-getting-comfortable-launching-starliner-with-a-known-leak/">discovered a helium leak</a> on the Starliner capsule itself. After several weeks of troubleshooting, NASA and Boeing officials decided to proceed with another launch attempt Saturday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029076#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029076&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration approved the commercial launch license for the fourth test flight of SpaceX's Starship rocket Tuesday, with liftoff from South Texas targeted for just after sunrise Thursday.</p>
<p>"The FAA has approved a license authorization for SpaceX Starship Flight 4," the agency said in a statement. "SpaceX met all safety and other licensing requirements for this test flight."</p>
<p>Shortly after the FAA announced the launch license, SpaceX confirmed plans to launch the fourth test flight of the world's largest rocket at 7:00 am CDT (12:00 UTC) Thursday. The launch window runs for two hours.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029047#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029047&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After a remarkably sensational regulatory drug review, advisers for the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly against approving <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/fdas-review-of-mdma-for-ptsd-highlights-study-bias-and-safety-concerns/">midomafetamine (MDMA, aka ecstasy or molly)</a> as part of therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>In a response to the question, "Do the available data show that the drug is effective in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder?" advisers voted 9 "no" to 2 "yes" against MDMA.</p>

<p>The venerable Hubble Space Telescope is running out of gyroscopes, and when none are left, the instrument will cease to conduct meaningful science.</p>
<p>To preserve the telescope, which has been operating in space for nearly three and a half decades, NASA announced Tuesday that it will reduce the Hubble's operations such that it will function on just a single gyroscope. This will limit some scientific operations, and it will take longer to point the telescope to new objects and lock onto them.</p>
<p>But in a conference call with space reporters, Hubble officials stressed that the beloved scientific instrument is not going anywhere any time soon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029000#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029000&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, a group of former OpenAI and Google DeepMind employees <a href="https://righttowarn.ai/">published</a> an open letter calling for AI companies to commit to principles allowing employees to raise concerns about AI risks without fear of retaliation. The letter, titled "A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence," has so far been signed by 13 individuals, including some who chose to remain anonymous due to concerns about potential repercussions.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The signatories argue that while AI has the potential to deliver benefits to humanity, it also poses serious risks that include "further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/">human extinction</a>."</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">They also assert that AI companies possess substantial non-public information about their systems' capabilities, limitations, and risk levels, but currently have only weak obligations to share this information with governments and none with civil society.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028761#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028761&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
