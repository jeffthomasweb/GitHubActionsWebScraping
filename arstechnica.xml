              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, a three-judge panel struck down net neutrality rules that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had hoped would stop broadband providers from varying speeds for users when connecting to different websites.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ohio-Telecom-v-FCC-Sixth-Circuit-Opinion-1-2-24.pdf">opinion</a>, US circuit judge Richard Allen Griffin wrote that the FCC lacked the authority to impose the net neutrality rules under the "telecommunications service" provision of the Communications Act.</p>
<p>"The core of the dispute here," Griffin wrote, "is whether Broadband Internet Service Providers" like Xfinity or Spectrum offer a "telecommunications service" or an "information service." Because judges agreed they offer the latter, the court ruled that they could not be subjected to the FCC's net neutrality policies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/appeals-court-blocks-fccs-efforts-to-bring-back-net-neutrality-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/these-are-the-lasting-things-that-half-life-2-gave-us-besides-headcrabs-and-crowbars/">more than two decades since <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>'s release have been filled with plenty of rumors and hints about <em>Half-Life 3</em>, ranging from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/valve-secrets-spill-over-including-half-life-3-in-new-steam-documentary-app/">official</a>-<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/valve-half-life-alyx-is-not-the-end-of-the-franchise/">ish</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">thin</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/mysterious-black-mesa-website-says-its-not-secretly-working-on-half-life-3/">downright</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">misleading</a>. As we head into 2025, though, we're approaching something close to a critical mass of rumors and leaks suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is really in the works this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months.</p>
<p>The latest tease came just before the end of 2024 via <a href="https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922">a New Year's Eve social media video</a> from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788587/">G-Man voice actor Mike Shapiro</a>. In the voice of the mysterious in-game bureaucrat, Shapiro expresses hopes that "the next quarter century [will] deliver as many <em>unexpected surprises</em> as did the millennium's first (emphasis added)... See you in the new year."</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The post is all the more notable because it's Shapiro's first in over four years, when he concluded a flurry of promotional posts surrounding the release of <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> (many of which were in-character as G-Man). And in 2020, just after <em>Alyx</em>'s release, Shapiro <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mike-shapiro-voice-of-the-g-man-says-the-next-game-hes-in-will-be-like-seeing-an-old-friend-again">told USGamer</a> that he had recently worked on a "blast from the past" project that he would "announce... on my Twitter feed when I'm allowed to" (no such announcement has been forthcoming for any other game).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/is-2025-finally-the-real-year-of-half-life-3-confirmed/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>People have been complaining for a while that passing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> is too difficult, but <a href="https://x.com/rauchg/status/1874130110120706556">developer and tech CEO Guillermo Rauch</a> has made one of the hardest yet: a fully playable <a href="https://doom-captcha.vercel.app/">CAPTCHA based on the classic PC game <em>Doom</em></a>.</p>
<p>It's been a long-running joke that developers will make <em>Doom</em> run on absolutely anything, so it's not much of a surprise that it's now running inside something that resembles a CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>The app essentially amounts to a small <em>Doom</em> level that is playable with keyboard controls (arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot) within a CAPTCHA-like presentation. You must kill three enemies to pass the test.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/someone-made-a-captcha-where-you-play-doom-on-nightmare-difficulty/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Apple has already pulled devices to comply with the Common Charger Directive.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>"It's time for THE charger," the <a href="https://x.com/eu_commission/status/1872885193255915618?s=12&amp;mx=2">European Commission posted to X</a> on December 28, 2024. While the sentiment only applies to one continent (and not all of it) and only certain devices, the Common Charger Directive now in effect in the European Union suggests that far fewer gadgets will foist barrels, USB-micro, or proprietary plugs onto their owners.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202402997">Common Charger Directive</a> demands that a "USB-C receptacle" be equipped on "radio equipment" that is "equipped with a removable or embedded rechargeable battery" and "can be recharged via wired charging." If it has a battery and can be powered by up to 100 watts through a USB-C connection, it's generally subject to the EU's USB-C requirements. The directive applies to devices "placed on the market"—sent to a distributor or buyer—after December 28, even if they were initially designed and sold before that date.</p>
<p>Laptops get until April 2026 to comply, but most other things—phones, tablets, handheld gaming devices, computer accessories, and wireless headphones—will have to be powered by USB-C to be sold inside the EU from now on. Drones, for the time being, are largely unaddressed by the directive, but the EU will likely get around to them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/usb-c-is-now-a-legal-requirement-for-most-rechargeable-gadgets-in-europe/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple has <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Lopez-v-Apple-Unopposed-Motion-for-Preliminary-Approval-of-Class-Action-Settlement-12-31-24.pdf">agreed</a> to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that its voice assistant Siri routinely recorded private conversations that were then shared with third parties and used for targeted ads.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Lopez-v-Apple-Proposed-Settlement-Agreement-12-31-2024.pdf">proposed class-action settlement</a>—which comes after five years of litigation—Apple admitted to no wrongdoing. Instead, the settlement refers to "unintentional" Siri activations that occurred after the "Hey, Siri" feature was introduced in 2014, where recordings were apparently prompted without users ever saying the trigger words, "Hey, Siri."</p>
<p>Sometimes Siri would be inadvertently activated, a whistleblower <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings">told The Guardian</a>, when an Apple Watch was raised and speech was detected. The only clue that users seemingly had of Siri's alleged spying was eerily accurate targeted ads that appeared after they had just been talking about specific items like Air Jordans or brands like Olive Garden, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">noted</a> (claims which remain disputed).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's January, and for people in the US, that means the same thing it's meant every January <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/a-whole-years-worth-of-works-just-fell-into-the-public-domain/">since 2019</a>: a new batch of previously copyrighted works have entered the public domain. People can publish, modify, and adapt these works and their characters without needing to clear rights or pay royalties.</p>
<p>This year's introductions cover books, plays, movies, art, and musical compositions from 1929, plus sound recordings from 1924. Most works released from 1923 onward are protected for 95 years after their release under the terms of 1998's Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. This law prevented new works from entering the public domain for two decades.</p>
<p>As it does every year, the Duke University Center for the Study of the Public Domain <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2025/">has a rundown</a> of the most significant works entering the public domain this year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/its-january-which-means-another-batch-of-copyrighted-work-is-now-public-domain/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[A new year, a new attempt at 3D displays. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Samsung is starting 2025 with a fresh attempt at popularizing 3D displays. Announced today, Samsung’s Odyssey 3D is the follow-up to prototypes that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/samsung-3d-2d-gaming-monitor-ces-2024/">Samsung demoed</a> at last year's CES technology trade show. This year, Samsung is showing off a final product, which is supposed to make 2D content look 3D.</p>
<p>Those who have dealt with 3D glasses may be relieved to hear that the Odyssey 3D doesn't require them. According to the South Korean company’s announcement, the monitor's use of a lenticular lens that is “attached to the front of the panel and its front stereo camera" means that you don't have to wear glasses to access the monitor's “customizable 3D experience.” Lenticular lenses direct different images to each eye to make images look three-dimensional. This is a notable advancement from the first 3D monitor that Samsung <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1239184512">released in 2009</a>. That display used Nvidia software and Nvidia shutter glasses to allow users to toggle between a 2D view and a 3D view through a few button presses and supported content.</p>
<p>Another advancement is the Odyssey 3D's claimed ability to use artificial intelligence “to analyze and convert 2D video into 3D.” We’ve recently seen similar technology from brands like Acer, which announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/acers-new-portable-monitors-can-make-2d-look-like-3d/">portable monitors</a> in 2022 and then announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/asus-new-16-inch-workstation-laptops-have-3d-oled-screens/">laptops</a> that could convert 2D content into stereoscopic 3D in 2023. Those displays also relied on AI, as well as a specialized optical lens and a pair of eye-tracking cameras, to create the effect. But unlike Acer's portable monitors, Samsung claims that its monitor can make 2D content look like 3D even if that content doesn’t officially support 3D.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/samsung-is-the-next-company-to-try-to-popularize-3d-displays-again/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[After S2 got 68 million views in first three days, <em>Squid Game</em>'s third season is already being teased.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p><em>Squid Game</em>'s hotly anticipated second season debuted on Netflix the day after Christmas and <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/squid-game-season-3-teaser-new-killer-doll-1236244914/">racked up</a> more than 68 million views in just three days. It had already been renewed for a third and final season—filmed back-to-back with S2—but Netflix ushered in the new year by gracing us with a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1874455538844553391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1874455538844553391%7Ctwgr%5E6957d5447651ca59808ccefa82ff97b1514d3c89%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2025%2F01%2Fsquid-game-season-3-teaser-new-killer-doll-1236244914%2F">15-second teaser</a> on X, introducing a brand new killer doll dubbed Chul-su—similar to the giant "Red Light, Green Light" doll Young-hee.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below; some spoilers for S2 but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/player-456-is-back-for-revenge-in-squid-game-s2-trailer/">previously reported</a>, the first season followed Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-Jae, seen earlier this year in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/disney-cancels-the-acolyte-after-one-season/"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>), a down-on-his-luck gambler who has little left to lose when he agrees to play children's playground games against 455 other players for money. The twist? If you lose a game, you die. If you cheat, you die. And if you win, you might also die.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/meet-squid-game-s3s-new-killer-doll/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Carbon fiber, aluminum, maybe the odd bit of titanium here or there: These are the materials we usually expect race cars to be made of. Now you can start adding thermoplastics like Ultem to the list. Additive manufacturing has become a real asset in the racer’s toolbox, although the technology has actually been used at the track longer than you might think.</p>
<p>"Some people think that 3D printing was invented last year," said Fadi Abro, senior global director of automotive and mobility at Stratasys. The company recently became NASCAR's official 3D printing partner, but it has a relationship with one of the teams—Joe Gibbs Racing—that stretches back two decades.</p>
<p>"Now the teams only have certain things that they can touch in the vehicle, but what that does is it makes it so that every microscopic advantage you can get out of that one tiny detail that you have control over is so meaningful to your team," Abro said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/how-nascar-and-its-teams-are-embracing-3d-printing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's getting harder to access popular adult sites in the US South.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Pornhub's owner, Aylo, kicked off the new year by blocking two more states that implemented age verification laws requiring ID to access porn, Florida and South Carolina. <a href="https://www.404media.co/pornhub-is-now-blocked-in-almost-all-of-the-u-s-south/">According to 404 Media</a>, these states are now among 16 states where Aylo sites, including Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn, cannot be accessed. Tennessee also risked being blocked, but a <a href="https://www.xbiz.com/news/286326/fsc-court-blocks-tennessee-age-verification-law">court preliminarily blocked its age-verification law</a> from taking effect.</p>
<p>The other blocked states are Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Mapping it out, 404 Media noted that the Aylo blackout spans nearly the entire US South, with Georgia's age verification law set to take effect in July and likely to trigger another block that would almost complete the blackout.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/almost-the-entire-us-south-is-now-being-blocked-by-pornhub/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Silicon chip manufacturers like Intel and TSMC are constantly outdoing themselves to make ever smaller features, but they are getting closer to the physical limits of silicon.</p>
<p>“We already have very, very high density in silicon-based architectures where silicon performance degrades sharply,” said Ki Seok Kim, a scientist working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Research Laboratory of Electronics.</p>
<p>One way around this problem is to replace silicon with graphene-like 2D materials that maintain their semiconducting properties even at a single-atom scale. Another way is building 3D chips, which squeeze more transistors into the same area without making transistors smaller. Kim’s team did both, building a 3D chip out of vertically stacked 2D semiconductors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/making-a-3d-stack-of-transistors-made-from-2d-materials/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Tesla sold almost 1.8 million cars in 2024, according to data released by the company this morning. Unfortunately for the electric automaker, it sold more than 1.8 million cars in 2023, beating this year's effort by 19,355 vehicles. But unlike last year, it sold more cars than it built, with production falling by 4 percent in 2024.</p>
<p>In the final quarter of 2024, Tesla built 436,718 Models 3 and Y and delivered 471,930, clearing out a stash of inventory in the process. It built an additional 22,727 electric vehicles—the elderly Models S and X and the divisive Cybertruck—and sold 23,640 of them during the same three months. So in Q4 2024, Tesla actually achieved modest, year-over-year growth in total sales of about 2 percent.</p>
<p>But the picture of the year as a whole is less rosy. Model 3 and Y sales fell by 2 percent year over year, with production falling by slightly more. As noted, this appears to have allowed Tesla to reduce what was at one point a growing inventory of unsold vehicles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/tesla-sales-fell-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Russian space program reached a significant milestone over the holidays with the 2,000th launch of a rocket from the "R-7" family of boosters. The launch took place on Christmas Day when an R-7 rocket lifted off, carrying a remote-sensing satellite from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</p>
<p>This family of rockets has an incredible heritage dating back nearly six decades. The first R-7 vehicle was designed by the legendary Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev. It flew in 1957 and was the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile. Because the first Soviet nuclear warheads were massive, the R-7 vehicle was powerful enough to be converted into an orbital rocket.</p>
<p>A modified version of the R-7 rocket, therefore, launched the Sputnik satellite later in 1957. And the slightly more powerful "Vostok" version of the booster carried Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, opening the era of human spaceflight. The first Soyuz variant, a rocket that has been upgraded multiple times but remains similar to its original form, flew in 1966. Humans still fly on the Soyuz rocket today to the International Space Station.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/russia-just-launched-the-2000th-semyorka-rocket-its-both-a-triumph-and-tragedy/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Beyond flint-knapping and tossing spears with atlatls, Kent State University's Metin Eren has a vision for his field's future.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Back <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/knives-made-of-frozen-feces-dont-make-the-cut-disproving-well-known-legend/">in 2019</a>, we told you about an intriguing experiment to test a famous anthropological legend about an elderly Inuit man in the 1950s who fashioned a knife out of his own frozen feces. He used it to kill and skin a dog, using its rib cage as a makeshift sled to venture off into the Arctic. Metin Eren, an archaeologist at Kent State University, fashioned rudimentary blades out of his own frozen feces to test whether they could cut through pig hide, muscle, and tendon.</p>
<p>Sadly for the legend, the blades failed every test, but the study was colorful enough to snag Eren <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/bellowing-alligators-and-frozen-poop-knives-the-2020-ig-nobel-prizes/">an Ig Nobel Prize</a> the following year. And it's just one of the many fascinating projects routinely undertaken in his <a href="https://www.kent.edu/anthropology/experimental-archaeology-laboratory">Experimental Archaeology Laboratory</a>, where he and his team try to reverse-engineer all manner of ancient technologies, whether they involve stone tools, ceramics, metal, butchery, textiles, and so forth.</p>
<p>Eren's lab is quite prolific, publishing 15 to 20 papers a year. “The only thing we’re limited by is time,” he said. Many have colorful or quirky elements and hence tend to garner media attention, but Eren emphasizes that what he does is very much serious science, not entertainment. “I think sometimes people look at experimental archaeology and think it’s no different from LARPing,” Eren told Ars. “I have nothing against LARPers, but it’s very different. It’s not playtime. It’s hardcore science. Me making a stone tool is no different than a chemist pouring chemicals into a beaker. But that act alone is not the experiment. It might be the flashiest bit, but that's not the experimental process.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/inside-the-hands-on-lab-of-an-experimental-archaeologist/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There aren't that many movies specifically set on New Year's Eve, but one of the best is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hudsucker_Proxy"><em>The Hudsucker Proxy</em></a> (1994), Joel and Ethan Coen's visually striking, affectionate homage to classic Hollywood screwball comedies. The film turned 30 this year, so it's the perfect opportunity for a rewatch.</p>
<p><strong>(WARNING: Spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<p>The Coen brothers started writing the script for <em>The Hudsucker Proxy</em> when Joel was working as an assistant editor on Sam Raimi's <em>The Evil Dead</em> (1981). Raimi ended up co-writing the script, as well as making a cameo appearance as a brainstorming marketing executive.  The Coen brothers took their inspiration from the films of Preston Sturgess and Frank Capra, among others, but the intent was never to satirize or parody those films. "It's the case where, having seen those movies, we say 'They're really fun—let's do one!'; as opposed to "They're really fun—let's comment upon them,'" Ethan Coen has said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/the-perfect-new-years-eve-comedy-turns-30/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Manta rays are elegantly shaped. They swim by flapping their fins like enormous wings, and their gills filter for plankton with the utmost precision. These creatures have now inspired human innovations that take soft robots and water filters to the next level.</p>
<p>With fins that borrow their shape and motion from mantas, a soft robot created by a team of researchers at North Carolina State University and the University of Virginia improves on a previous model by reaching speeds of 6.8 body lengths per second, nearly double what its predecessor was capable of. This makes it the fastest soft robot so far. It is also more energy-efficient than its previous iteration and can swim not just on the surface, but upward and downward, just like an actual manta ray.</p>
<p>Another research team at MIT used the gills of these creatures, which filter for plankton, to improve commercial water filtration systems. Their gill openings are also the perfect size to help them breathe while they feed, absorbing oxygen from water on its way out. The rays’ balance of feeding and breathing helped the researchers figure out a filter structure that more precisely controls inflow and outflow.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/manta-rays-inspire-faster-swimming-robots-and-better-water-filters/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ahead of a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-crypto-mining-ban-2025-2031">major crackdown on illegal cryptocurrency mines in Russia</a> next year, a power provider in Siberia has been fined for illegally leasing state land that's supposed to be used only for public utilities to an illegal mining operation.</p>
<p>In a social media <a href="https://vk.com/wall-213611955_10193">post</a> translated by Ars, the Irkutsk Region Prosecutor-General’s Office explained that the power provider was fined more than 330,000 rubles (about $3,000) for the improper land use. Local prosecutors will also pursue an administrative case against the power provider, the office said.</p>
<p>Crypto mining is popular in Siberia because of low operating costs, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-miner-hunting-siberian-power-provider-finds-illegal-farm-on-its-own-property/">Crypto News noted</a>, due to the cool temperatures and cheap power supply. But many in Siberia have blamed crypto miners for power outages and grid instability that can cause significant harms during winter months.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/russian-power-provider-struck-deal-that-hid-illegal-crypto-mine-on-state-land/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the holiday weekend, all but one member of the editorial board of Elsevier's <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-human-evolution">Journal of Human Evolution</a> (JHE) resigned "with heartfelt sadness and great regret," <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/27/evolution-journal-editors-resign-en-masse-to-protest-elsevier-changes/">according to Retraction Watch</a>, which helpfully provided an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Social-Media-Statement-re-JHE-Resignations.pdf">online PDF</a> of the editors' full statement. It's the 20th <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">mass resignation</a> from a science journal since 2023 over various points of contention, per Retraction Watch, many in response to controversial changes in the business models used by the scientific publishing industry.</p>
<p>"This has been an exceptionally painful decision for each of us," the board members wrote in their statement. "The editors who have stewarded the journal over the past 38 years have invested immense time and energy in making JHE the leading journal in paleoanthropological research and have remained loyal and committed to the journal and our authors long after their terms ended. The [associate editors] have been equally loyal and committed. We all care deeply about the journal, our discipline, and our academic community; however, we find we can no longer work with Elsevier in good conscience."</p>
<p>The editorial board cited several changes made over the last ten years that it believes are counter to the journal's longstanding editorial principles. These included eliminating support for a copy editor and a special issues editor, leaving it to the editorial board to handle those duties. When the board expressed the need for a copy editor, Elsevier's response, they said, was "to maintain that the editors should not be paying attention to language, grammar, readability, consistency, or accuracy of proper nomenclature or formatting."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/journal-editors-resign-to-protest-ai-use-high-fees-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>
