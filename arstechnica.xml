                            <![CDATA[<p>The Israel-linked hacker group known as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/predatory-sparrow-cyberattack-timeline/">Predatory Sparrow</a> has carried out some of the most disruptive and destructive cyberattacks in history, twice disabling thousands of gas station payment systems across Iran and once even setting a steel mill in the country on fire. Now, in the midst of a new war unfolding between the two countries, they appear to be bent on burning Iran's financial system.</p>
<p>Predatory Sparrow, which often goes by its Farsi name, Gonjeshke Darande, in an effort to appear as a homegrown hacktivist organization, announced in a post on on its X account Wednesday that it had targeted the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, accusing the exchange of enabling sanctions violations and terrorist financing on behalf of the Iranian regime. According to cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic, the hackers <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/iranian-crypto-exchange-nobitex-hacked-pro-israel-group" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/iranian-crypto-exchange-nobitex-hacked-pro-israel-group" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">destroyed more than $90 million</a> in Nobitex holdings, a rare instance of hackers burning crypto assets rather than stealing them.</p>
<p>“These cyberattacks are the result of Nobitex being a key regime tool for financing terrorism and violating sanctions,” the hackers posted to X. “Associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts your assets at risk.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/israel-tied-predatory-sparrow-hackers-are-waging-cyberwar-on-irans-financial-system/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The late-night explosion at SpaceX's rocket development complex in Starbase, Texas, destroyed the bullet-shaped upper stage that was slated to launch on the next Starship test flight. The powerful blast set off fires around SpaceX's Massey's Test Site, located a few miles from the company's Starship factory and launch pads.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Critics have long warned that Donald Trump's pro-cryptocurrency push as president, coupled with his links to his family's growing crypto empire, creates substantial conflicts of interest that must be probed.</p>
<p>But so far, nothing has stopped Trump's family from seemingly benefiting from the presidency while expanding their empire. And now, Trump is rushing regulation through Congress that many Democrats fear could create his biggest conflict of interest yet.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill that will regulate stablecoins in the US, establishing guardrails and consumer protections that may spur wider crypto adoption nationwide. Unlike more volatile forms of cryptocurrency—like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/bitcoin-plunges-as-crypto-fans-didnt-get-everything-they-wanted-from-trump/">Trump's controversial memecoin</a>—stablecoins' value can be pegged to the US dollar. The crypto industry is hoping the House of Representatives will quickly send the bill to Trump's desk, which Trump has demanded happen by August.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/senate-passes-genius-act-criticized-as-gifting-trump-ample-opportunity-to-grift/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">StreamTV Insider provided flights from New York City to Denver and two nights of accommodation so Ars could attend its StreamTV Show. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>DENVER—Most smart TV operating system (OS) owners are in the ad sales business now. Software providers for budget and premium TVs are honing their ad skills, which requires advancing their ability to collect user data. This is creating an “inherent conflict” within the industry, Takashi Nakano, VP of content and programming at Samsung TV Plus, said at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/inside-the-firm-turning-eerie-blank-streaming-ads-into-useful-nonprofit-messages/">StreamTV Show</a> in Denver last week.</p>
<p>During a panel at StreamTV Insider’s conference entitled “CTV OS Leader Roundtable: From Drivers to Engagement and Content Strategy,” Nakano acknowledged the opposing needs of advertisers and smart TV users, who are calling for a reasonable amount of data privacy.</p>
<p>“Do you want your data sold out there and everyone to know exactly what you’ve been watching … the answer is generally no,” the Samsung executive said. “Yet, advertisers want all of this data. They wanna know exactly what you ate for breakfast."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/tv-brands-face-inherent-conflict-over-user-privacy-advertiser-data-demands/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tech support scammers have devised a method to inject their fake phone numbers into webpages when a target's web browser visits official sites for Apple, PayPal, Netflix, and other companies.</p>
<p>The ruse, outlined in a <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/scammers-hijack-websites-of-bank-of-america-netflix-microsoft-and-more-to-insert-fake-phone-number">post on Wednesday</a> from security firm Malwarebytes, threatens to trick users into calling the malicious numbers even when they think they're taking measures to prevent falling for such scams. One of the more common pieces of security advice is to carefully scrutinize the address bar of a browser to ensure it's pointing to an organization’s official website. The ongoing scam is able to bypass such checks.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>With ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the country's top health position, use of a long-approved vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella/chickenpox (MMRV) as well as flu shots that include the preservative thimerosal will now be reevaluated, putting their future availability and use in question. The development seemingly continues to vindicate health experts' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-expected-to-rebuild-cdc-panel-with-anti-vaxxers-he-claims-he-wont/">worst fears</a> that, as health secretary, Kennedy would attack and dismantle the federal government's scientifically rigorous, evidence-based vaccine recommendations.</p>
<p>Discussions of the two types of vaccines now appear <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-18.pdf">on the agenda</a> of a meeting for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) scheduled for two days next week (June 25 and 26).</p>
<h2>ACIP’s overhaul</h2>
<p>On June 9, Kennedy summarily <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-fires-entire-cdc-panel-of-vaccine-advisors/">fired all 17 members of ACIP</a>, who were rigorously vetted—esteemed scientists and clinicians in the fields of immunology, epidemiology, pediatrics, obstetrics, internal and family medicine, geriatrics, infectious diseases, and public health. Two days later, Kennedy installed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/yep-rfk-jr-appoints-anti-vaccine-advocates-to-cdc-vaccine-panel/">eight new members</a>, many with dubious qualifications and several known to hold anti-vaccine views.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/after-rfk-jr-overhauls-cdc-panel-measles-and-flu-vaccines-are-up-for-debate/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The 2009 discovery of footprints (human and animal) left behind in layers of clay and silt at New Mexico’s White Sands National Park sparked a contentious debate about when, exactly, human cultures first developed in North America. Until about a decade ago, it seemed as if the first Americans arrived near the end of the last Ice Age and were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/new-study-adds-evidence-to-debate-over-the-only-known-clovis-burial/">part of the Clovis culture</a>, named for the distinctive projectile points they left behind near what’s now Clovis, New Mexico. But various dating methods indicated the White Sands footprints are 10,000 years older. Now there is a fresh independent analysis that agrees with those earlier findings, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv4951">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/23000-year-old-footprints-suggest-people-reached-the-americas-early/">previously reported</a>, earlier archaeological evidence had suggested the Clovis people made their way southward through a corridor that opened up in the middle of the ice sheets between 13,000 and 16,000 years ago. Subsequent archaeological evidence—such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/underwater-discovery-reveals-14550-year-old-florida-mastodon-hunters/">a 14,500-year-old site in Florida</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/16000-year-old-site-in-idaho-indicates-people-sailed-around-the-ice-sheet/">stone tools dating to 16,000 years ago in western Idaho</a>—suggested that the Clovis people were actually not the first to arrive. It also made it look much more likely that the first Americans had skirted the edge of the ice sheets along the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>The White Sands footprints further muddled the narrative. In 2019, Bournemouth University archaeologist Matthew Bennett and his colleagues excavated the White Sands area and found a total of 61 human footprints east of an area called Alkali Flat, which was once the bed and shoreline of an ancient lake. Over time, as the lake’s edge expanded and contracted with shifts in climate, it left behind distinct layers of clay, silt, and sand. Seven of those layers, in the area Bennett and his colleagues excavated, held human tracks along with those of long-lost megafauna.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/study-confirms-white-sands-footprints-are-23000-years-old/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><span class="bolded">Earlier this year,</span> a biomedical researcher at the University of Michigan received an update from the National Institutes of Health. The federal agency, which funds a large swath of the country’s medical science, had given the green light to begin releasing funding for the upcoming year on the researcher’s multi-year grant.</p>
<p>Not long after, the researcher learned that the university had placed the grant on hold. The school’s lawyers, it turned out, were wrestling with a difficult question: whether to accept new terms in the Notice of Award, a legal document that outlines the grant’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Other researchers at the university were having the same experience. Indeed, Undark’s reporting suggests that the University of Michigan—among the top three university recipients of NIH funding in 2024, with more than $750 million in grants—had quietly frozen some, perhaps all, of its incoming NIH funding dating back to at least the second half of April.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/via-the-false-claims-act-nih-puts-universities-on-edge/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The blackout that took down the Iberian grid serving Spain and Portugal in April was the result of a number of smaller interacting problems, according to an investigation by the Spanish government. The report concludes that several steps meant to address a small instability made matters worse, eventually leading to a self-reinforcing cascade where high voltages caused power plants to drop off the grid, thereby increasing the voltage further. Critically, the report suggests that the Spanish grid operator had an unusually low number of plants on call to stabilize matters, and some of the ones it did have responded poorly.</p>
<p>The full report will be available later today; however, the government <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/2702b812ce1f3e6da64933b9d/files/f543f912-b15e-d3ae-8a8a-e393bf6fdfb6/20250617_NdP_Se_presenta_el_informe_del_Comit_eacute__de_an_aacute_lisis_de_la.pdf">released a summary</a> ahead of its release. The document includes a timeline of the events that triggered the blackout, as well as an analysis of why grid management failed to keep it in check. It also notes that a parallel investigation checked for indications of a cyberattack and found none.</p>
<h2>Oscillations and a cascade</h2>
<p>The document notes that for several days prior to the blackout, the Iberian grid had been experiencing voltage fluctuations—products of a mismatch between supply and demand—that had been managed without incident. These continued through the morning of April 28 until shortly after noon, when an unusual frequency oscillation occurred. This oscillation has been traced back to a single facility on the grid, but the report doesn't identify it or even indicate its type, simply referring to it as an "instalación."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/spanish-blackout-report-power-plants-meant-to-stabilize-voltage-didnt/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Microsoft confirmed that it's not abandoning the home console market just yet. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA">a short video teaser</a>, Xbox President Sarah Bond highlighted a "strategic multi-year partnership with AMD" that will include "our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands." But while we know that the "in your hands" part will include devices <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">like the Windows-powered ROG Xbox Ally</a>, there are still few specifics about what exactly Microsoft has planned for its future living room consoles (aside from what Bond calls "the next generation of graphics innovation").</p>
<p>Reading between the lines a bit, though, we wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft was getting ready to finally tear down the thinning wall separating gaming PCs and gaming consoles. A Windows-based, living room-focused Xbox capable of running generic Windows games could accentuate Microsoft's strengths in PC gaming while papering over many of the company's recent struggles in the home console market.</p>
<h2>WindowsBox</h2>
<p>The once-bright line separating PC gaming and TV-based console gaming has been deteriorating for years. On the hardware side, bespoke console chips and development environments long ago gave way to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps4-pc-like-architecture-8gb-ram-delight-developers">PC-like architectures</a> that are simpler and easier for developers to work with. And on the PC interface side, efforts like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/steam-comes-to-the-living-room-tv-with-big-picture-mode-beta/">Steam's Big Picture mode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steamos/">SteamOS as a whole</a> have strived to make playing on a PC with a handheld controller into a more console-like experience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The world’s largest streaming provider announced today that starting next year, all Netflix subscribers in France will be able to watch broadcast channels from TF1 Group, France’s biggest commercial broadcaster, which also owns streaming services and creates content. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4dc9accc-0024-46b6-bf33-a4125239e238">Financial Times</a> (FT) reported that users will be able to watch all five TF1 linear channels.</p>
<p>Netflix’s French customers will also gain access to “more than 30,000 hours” of on-demand TF1 content in the summer of 2026, FT reported. TF1’s content selection includes scripted dramas, reality shows like<em> The Voice</em>, and live sports.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/netflix-will-start-showing-traditional-broadcast-channels-next-summer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Even in the age of TikTok, YouTube viewership continues to climb. While Google's iconic video streaming platform has traditionally pushed creators to produce longer videos that can accommodate more ads, the site's Shorts format is growing fast. That growth may explode in the coming months, as YouTube CEO Neal Mohan has announced that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/googles-will-smith-double-is-better-at-eating-ai-spaghetti-but-its-crunchy/">Google Veo 3</a> AI video generator will be integrated with YouTube Shorts later this summer.</p>
<p>According to Mohan, YouTube Shorts has seen a rise in popularity even compared to YouTube as a whole. The streaming platform is now the most watched source of video in the world, but Shorts specifically have seen a massive 186 percent increase in viewership over the past year. Mohan says Shorts now average 200 billion daily views.</p>
<p>YouTube has already equipped creators with a few AI tools, including Dream Screen, which can produce AI video backgrounds with a text prompt. Veo 3 support will be a significant upgrade, though. At the Cannes festival, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/neal-mohan-cannes-2025/">Mohan revealed</a> that the streaming site will begin offering integration with Google's leading video model later this summer. "I believe these tools will open new creative lanes for everyone to explore," said Mohan.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/googles-veo-3-ai-videos-will-come-to-youtube-shorts-this-summer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The White House confirmed that Donald Trump has extended the deadline for a TikTok sale for a third time, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-he-will-probably-extend-tiktok-deadline-again-2025-06-17/">reported</a> Wednesday.</p>
<p>Now, China-based ByteDance has 90 days to divest its US assets or potentially be forced to shut down US operations. Trump's announcement came one day before the June 19 deadline he established through his last extension. That extension was necessary after Vice President JD Vance failed to make a "high-level" deal expected in April, which Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/03/jd-vance-tiktok-00271530">branded</a> a "make or break moment" where Vance could have secured a big win.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that China was holding up the sale, suggesting that China may have an upper hand in TikTok negotiations, and perhaps TikTok is losing its sheen as a US bargaining chip in Trump's bigger trade war.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trump-suggests-he-needs-china-to-sign-off-on-tiktok-sale-delays-deal-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>"What's this purple laptop? It's cool."</p>
<p>Over a decade-plus of doing gadget reviews and review-adjacent things, my wife (and, lately, my 5-year-old) have mostly stopped commenting on the ever-shifting selection of laptops I have in my bag or lying around the house at any given time. Maybe she can't tell them apart, or maybe she just figures there isn't that much to say about whatever black or silver metal slab I'm carrying around. Either way, they practically never elicit any kind of response, unless there are just too many of them sitting out in too many places.</p>
<p>But she <em>did</em> ask about the Framework Laptop 12, the third and latest major design in Framework's slowly expanding lineup of modular, repairable, upgradeable laptops. With its five two-toned color options and sturdy plastic exterior, it's definitely more approachable and friendly-looking than the Laptop 13 or Laptop 16, both metal slabs with a somewhat less-finished and prototype-y look to them. But it retains the features that a certain kind of PC geek likes about Framework's other laptops—user-customizable and swappable ports, an easy-to-open design, first-class Linux support, and the promise of future upgrades that improve its performance and other specs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/framework-laptop-12-review-im-excited-to-see-what-the-2nd-generation-looks-like/">Read full article</a></p>

The paleoanthropologists who studied the Harbin skull in 2021 declared it a new (to us) species, <i>Homo longi</i>. But the Harbin skull still contains enough of its original proteins to tell a different story: A few of them matched specific proteins from Denisovan bones and teeth, as encoded in Denisovan DNA.</p>
<p>So <i>Homo longi</i> was a Denisovan all along, and thanks to the remarkably well-preserved skull, we finally know what the enigmatic Denisovans actually looked like.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washignton, DC, to Denver and accommodation so Ars could drive the A5 and S5, as well as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/the-new-version-of-audis-best-selling-q5-suv-arrives-in-the-us/">Q5 and SQ5</a>. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>ASPEN, Colo.—The SUV might be the dominant design in the American automobile market, but it hasn't completely taken over. At Audi, there is still life in the sedan. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/03/audis-new-2017-a4-is-for-nerds-by-nerds/">old A4 four-door</a> is no more—at least for a while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/porsche-and-audi-among-the-oems-planning-more-ice-and-hybrids/">or until Audi redoes its nomenclature yet again</a>. If you want a small Audi four-door, you need to step down to the A3. Five doors is where it's at, with the 2025 A5.</p>
<p>Like the new Q5 SUV, which you may have read about last week, the new A5 uses an all-new vehicle architecture from Audi called PPC (for premium platform combustion). PPC will give rise to a wide range of new vehicles from Audi, Porsche, and the other premium VW Group stablemates, and it takes a meaningful step into the future with advanced new electronics, making this a true <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/throw-out-all-those-black-boxes-and-say-hello-to-the-software-defined-car/">software-defined vehicle</a>.</p>
<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>There will be two versions at launch. The regular A5 features a 2.0 L four-cylinder turbocharged, direct-injection engine driving all four wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, and generates 268 hp (200 kW) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm). That's a pretty large power and torque bump compared to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/06/audis-a5-and-s5-sportback-a-performance-minded-detour-from-the-suv/">outgoing A5 Sportback</a>, in part thanks to a new variable geometry turbocharger that replaces the old twin-scroll blower.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/2025-audi-a5-and-s5-drive-the-fastback-needs-the-s-treatment-to-sizzle/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An experimental reusable rocket developed by the research and development arm of Honda Motor Company flew to an altitude of nearly 900 feet Tuesday, then landed with pinpoint precision at the carmaker's test facility in northern Japan.</p>
<p>The accomplishment may not sound like much, but it's important to put it into perspective. Honda's hopper is the first prototype rocket outside of the United States and China to complete a flight of this kind, demonstrating vertical takeoff and vertical landing technology that could underpin the development of a reusable launch vehicle.</p>
<p>While Tuesday's announcement by Honda was unexpected, the company has talked about rockets before. In 2021, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/honda-officials-detail-plans-to-build-a-small-reusable-orbital-rocket/">Honda officials revealed</a> they had been working on a rocket engine for at least two years.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Former Cloudflare executive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graham-Cumming">John Graham-Cumming</a> recently announced that he launched a <a href="https://lowbackgroundsteel.ai/">website</a>, lowbackgroundsteel.ai, that treats pre-AI, human-created content like a precious commodity—a time capsule of organic creative expression from a time before machines joined the conversation. "The idea is to point to sources of text, images and video that were created prior to the explosion of AI-generated content," Graham-Cumming <a href="https://blog.jgc.org/2025/06/low-background-steel-content-without-ai.html">wrote</a> on his blog last week. The reason? To preserve what made non-AI media uniquely human.</p>
<p>The archive name comes from a scientific phenomenon from the Cold War era. After nuclear weapons testing began in 1945, atmospheric radiation contaminated new steel production worldwide. For decades, scientists needing radiation-free metal for sensitive instruments had to salvage steel from pre-war shipwrecks. Scientists called this steel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-background_steel">"low-background steel."</a> Graham-Cumming sees a parallel with today's web, where AI-generated content increasingly mingles with human-created material and contaminates it.</p>
<p>With the advent of generative AI models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion in 2022, it has become far more difficult for researchers to ensure that media found on the Internet was created by humans without using AI tools. ChatGPT in particular triggered an avalanche of AI-generated text across the web, forcing at least one research project to shut down entirely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/why-one-man-is-archiving-human-made-content-from-before-the-ai-explosion/">Read full article</a></p>
