<p>Across the country, teams of students at 15 different universities are in the middle of a four-year project, dissecting an electric vehicle and figuring out ways to make it even better. The program, called the EcoCar EV Challenge, was founded more than three decades ago by the US Department of Energy and is run by the DOE's Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Over the last 35 years, more than 30,000 students from 95 universities have participated in the EcoCar Challenge, part of the DOE's Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition. Each segment spans four years, with the most recent cycle beginning in 2023 with a new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/">Cadillac Lyriq</a> donated by the General Motors automaker.</p>
<p>The students take this competition very seriously, as participation alone brings a lot of benefits, including the potential for a lifelong career path.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013389#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013389&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>About seven years ago, Aaron Silverbook and his then-girlfriend, a biologist, were perusing old scientific literature online. “A romantic evening,” joked Silverbook. That night, he came across a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC97174/">study</a> from 2000 that surprised him. Scientists had genetically engineered an oral bacterium that they said could possibly prevent tooth decay: “I read it and sort of boggled at it and said, ‘Wow, this is a cavity vaccine. Why don't we have this?’”</p>
<p>So, Silverbook tracked down the primary author, Jeffrey Hillman, a now-retired oral biologist formerly at the University of Florida, to see if he could pick up the torch.</p>
<p>In 2023, Silverbook founded Lantern Bioworks, which made a deal with Oragenics, the company Hillman co-founded and that owned the technology, for the materials. Lantern Bioworks then launched the genetically engineered bacteria under the name Lumina Probiotic. “I didn’t expect it to happen in my lifetime,” said Hillman.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018793#p3">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018793&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intermittent fasting, aka time-restricted eating, can help people lose weight—but the reason why may not be complicated hypotheses about changes from fasting metabolism or diurnal circadian rhythms. It may just be because restricting eating time means people eat fewer calories overall.</p>
<p>In a randomized-controlled trial, people who followed a time-restricted diet lost about the same amount of weight as people who ate the same diet without the time restriction, according to <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M23-3132">a study published Friday in Annals of Internal Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The finding offers a possible answer to a long-standing question for time-restricted eating (TRE) research, which has been consumed by small feeding studies of 15 people or fewer, with mixed results and imperfect designs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018837#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018837&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On March 29, 2022, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/rip-cnn-march-2022-april-2022/">CNN+</a>, CNN's take on a video streaming service, debuted. On <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2022/04/cnn-plus-shutting-down">April 28, 2022</a>, it shuttered, making it the fastest shutdown of any launched streaming service. Despite that discouraging superlative, CNN has plans for another subscription-based video streaming platform, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d6e8f7d5-2ef1-4b53-9a96-2f5920df3ba9">Financial Times</a> (FT) reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mark Thompson, who took CNN's helm in August 2023, over a year after CNN+'s demise, spoke with FT about evolving the company. The publication reported that Thompson is "working on plans for a digital subscription streaming service." The executive told the publication that a digital subscription, including digital content streaming, is "a serious possibility," adding, "no decisions had been made, but I think it’s quite likely that we’ll end up there."</p>
<p>CNN++, or whatever a new CNN streaming package might be named, would not just be another CNN+, per Thompson.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018728#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018728&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first-ever model of Star Trek's<em> USS Enterprise NCC-1701</em> has been returned to the Roddenberry family, according to an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/long-lost-uss-enterprise-model-returned-star-trek-109386944?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2fUsb8n33X5AE2pXxqmR1KrgNLwdpF8txWq8lMvtlEjVkcLqPbSaojNL4_aem_AdnrLvI49wv5ubUSx_g-D0qkhneh3dE3rOoPCqdrU0rC-mui7MewaEkTA1Dh_tiWFLp5RJJqOtwhVb22UqMzATaY">ABC News</a> report.</p>
<p>The three-foot model was used to shoot the pilot and credits scene for Star Trek's original series in the 1960s and was used occasionally for shots throughout the series. (Typically, a larger, 11-foot model was used for shots after the pilot.) The model also sat on series creator Gene Roddenberry's desk for several years.</p>
<p>It went missing in the late 1970s; historians and collectors believe it belonged to Roddenberry himself, that he lent it to a production house working on Star Trek: The Motion Picture<em>,</em> and that it was never returned. Its whereabouts were unknown until last fall, when a listing for a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/11/after-decades-lost-star-treks-original-enterprise-model-may-have-been-found/">mysterious model of the <em>Enterprise</em> appeared on eBay</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018712#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018712&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Perhaps the first clue that something was not quite right about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427740/Cities_Skylines_II__Beach_Properties/"><em>Beach Properties</em></a>, the first $10 DLC "expansion" for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/4/">the already off-kilter city-building sim </a><em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/4/">Cities: Skylines 2</a>, </em>was that it did not contain a real beach house, which one might consider a key beach property. The oversight seemed indicative of a content pack that lacked for content.</p>
<p><em>C:S2</em>'s developers and publisher now agree and have published <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-way-forward-an-update-from-the-team-behind-cities-skylines.1665858/">a letter to <em>Cities</em> fans</a>, in which they offer apologies, updates, and refunds. <em>Beach Properties </em>is now a free add-on, individual buyers will be refunded (with details at <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/faq-the-way-forward.1663862/">a FAQ page</a>), and Ultimate Edition owners will receive additional Creator Packs and Radio Stations, since partial refunds are tricky across different game stores.</p>
<p>"We thought we could make up for the shortcomings of the game in a timeframe that was unrealistic, and rushed out a DLC that should not have been published in its current form. For all this, we are truly sorry," reads the letter, signed by the CEOs of developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive.

<p>An executive producer of the Netflix hit <em>What Jennifer Did</em> has responded to accusations that the true crime documentary used AI images when depicting Jennifer Pan, a woman currently imprisoned in Canada for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2024/04/11/the-chilling-true-story-behind-netflixs-what-jennifer-did-your-questions-answered">orchestrating a murder-for-hire scheme targeting her parents</a>.</p>
<p><em>What Jennifer Did</em> shot to the top spot in Netflix's global top 10 when it debuted in early April, attracting swarms of true crime fans who wanted to know more about why Pan paid hitmen $10,000 to murder her parents. But quickly the documentary became a source of controversy, as fans started noticing glaring flaws in images used in the movie, from weirdly mismatched earrings to her nose appearing to lack nostrils, the Daily Mail <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13328073/Netflix-Jennifer-Did-AI-images-killer-Jennifer-Pan.html">reported</a>, in a post showing a plethora of examples of images from the film.</p>
<p>Futurism was among the first to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/netflix-what-jennifer-did-true-crime-ai-photos">point out</a> that these flawed images (around the 28-minute mark of the documentary) "have all the hallmarks of an AI-generated photo, down to mangled hands and fingers, misshapen facial features, morphed objects in the background, and a far-too-long front tooth." The image with the long front tooth was even used in Netflix's poster for the movie.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018753#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018753&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Huawei is still out there making phones, even if it has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/no-more-export-licenses-us-plans-to-fully-cut-off-huawei-from-chip-suppliers/">been shunned</a> by the US government and the US-aligned tech ecosystem. The latest phone has a new name: "<a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/pura70-ultra/">Huawei Pura 70</a>." While you wouldn't ever want to deal with the cobbled-together SoC or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/">whatever is going on</a> with Huawei's software, the "Ultra" model does have a cool party trick up its sleeve: a pop-out main camera lens.</p>
<p>In the years before the smartphone took over all entry-level photography, there used to be a thing called a "point-and-shoot camera." This was a purpose-built device that only took photos, couldn't go on the Internet, and wouldn't let you watch the latest TikTok videos. The trademark feature of these devices was a retractable camera lens, where the front lens (there was only one!) would grow out of the front of the camera when you turned it on. This would give your camera better, longer lens geometry to work with when the camera was on, and would collapse down for easier storage when it was off.</p>
<p>Huawei's latest phone is replicating that. The giant rear camera lens actually grows out of the phone somewhat, thanks to some complicated gearing inside the phone. It's only the tiniest few millimeters, but it's a start. Smartphone manufacturers often resist adding bigger lenses to their devices because they want to still have pocketable devices. A pop-up lens would give the camera engineers more room to work with while still maintaining pocketability.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018419#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018419&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ever since the Voyager mission sent home images of Jupiter's moon Io spewing material into space, we've gradually built up a clearer picture of Io's volcanic activity. It slowly became clear that Io, which is a bit smaller than Mercury, is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, with all that activity driven by the gravitational strain caused by Jupiter and its three other giant moons. There is so much volcanism that its surface has been completely remodeled, with no signs of impact craters.</p>
<p>A few more details about its violence came to light this week, with new images being released of the moon's features, including an island in a lake of lava, taken by the Juno orbiter. At the same time, imaging done using an Earth-based telescope has provided some indications that this volcanism has been reshaping Io from almost the moment it formed.</p>
<h2>Fiery, glassy lakes</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/">Juno orbiter's</a> mission is primarily focused on studying Jupiter, including the dynamics of its storms and its internal composition. But many of its orbital passes have taken it right past Io, and this week, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory released <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-gives-aerial-views-of-mountain-lava-lake-on-io">some of the best images</a> from these flybys. They include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg2Szj_OG_Q">a shot of Loki Patera</a>, a lake of lava that has an island within it. Also featured: the impossibly sheer slopes of Io's Steeple Mountain.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018730#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018730&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The miniaturization of retro tech has always been a major obsession for modders, from the person who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/hobbyist-grinds-down-original-chips-by-hand-to-make-a-game-boy-sized-nes/">fit an original NES</a> into a Game Boy-sized portable to the person who made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/honey-i-shrunk-the-mac-enthusiast-makes-the-mac-mini-more-mini/">a mini-er version of Apple's Mac mini</a>.</p>

<p>One mod in this storied genre that caught our eye this week is the "Short Stack," a scale model of the Nintendo Wii that packs the 2006 console's internal hardware into a 3D-printed enclosure roughly the size of a deck of playing cards.</p>
<p>"You could fit 13.5 of these inside an original Wii," writes James Smith (aka loopj), the person behind the project. All the design details, custom boards, and other information about recreating the mod <a href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack?tab=readme-ov-file">are available on GitHub</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018682#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018682&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Everyone with a Roku TV or streaming device will eventually be forced to enable two-factor authentication after the company disclosed two separate incidents in which roughly 600,000 customers had their accounts accessed through credential stuffing.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing">Credential stuffing</a> is an attack in which usernames and passwords exposed in one leak are tried out against other accounts, typically using automated scripts. When people reuse usernames and passwords across services or make small, easily intuited changes between them, actors can gain access to accounts with even more identifying information and access.</p>
<p>In the case of the Roku attacks, that meant access to stored payment methods, which could then be used to buy streaming subscriptions and Roku hardware. <a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/protecting-your-roku-account">Roku wrote on its blog</a>, and in <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Template%20Notification%203-8-2024.pdf">a mandated data breach report</a>, that purchases occurred in "less than 400 cases" and that full credit card numbers and other "sensitive information" was not revealed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018661#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018661&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An AI test pilot has successfully flown a jet fighter in dogfights against human opponents. It's the latest development for DARPA's Air Combat Evaluation program, which is trying to develop aerospace AI agents <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/air-combat-evolution">that can be trusted</a> to perform safely.</p>
<p>Human test pilots have a bit of a reputation thanks to popular culture—from <em>The Right Stuff</em> to <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, the profession has been portrayed as a place for loose cannons with a desire to go fast and break the rules. The reality is pretty far from that these days, especially where DARPA is concerned.</p>
<p>The agency instead wants a machine-learning agent that can safely fly a real aircraft autonomously, with no violations of training rules. After all, neural networks have their own reputation—at this point well-earned—for finding ways to exploit situations <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/sony-trains-superhuman-ai-to-race-in-gran-turismo/">that hadn't occurred to humans.</a> And the consequences when controlling a real jet fighter can be a lot more severe than just testing <em>in silico</em>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018649#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018649&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Although NASA is unlikely to speak about it publicly any time soon, the space agency is privately considering modifications to its Artemis plan to land astronauts on the surface of the Moon later this decade.</p>
<p>Multiple sources have confirmed that NASA is studying alternatives to the planned Artemis III landing of two astronauts on the Moon, nominally scheduled for September 2026, due to concerns about hardware readiness and mission complexity.</p>
<p>Under one of the options, astronauts would launch into low-Earth orbit inside an Orion spacecraft and rendezvous there with a Starship vehicle, separately launched by SpaceX. During this mission, similar to Apollo 9, a precursor to the Apollo 11 lunar landing, the crew would validate the ability of Orion and Starship to dock and test habitability inside Starship. The crew would then return to Earth. In another option NASA is considering, a crew would launch in Orion and fly to a small space station near the Moon, the Lunar Gateway, and then return to Earth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018588#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018588&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, we learned that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-stops-cybertruck-deliveries-accelerator-pedal-may-be-to-blame/">Tesla had suspended customer deliveries</a> of its stainless steel-clad electric pickup truck. Now, the automaker has issued a recall for all the Cybertrucks in customer hands—nearly 4,000 of them—in order to fix a problem with the accelerator pedal. It has come at an inconvenient time for Tesla, which is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-to-lay-off-more-than-10-percent-of-its-workers-as-sales-slow/">laying off</a> more than 10 percent of its workforce due to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-deliveries-drop-8-5-percent-year-over-year-in-first-decline-since-2020/">shrinking sales</a> even as CEO Elon Musk asks for an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/tesla-asks-shareholders-to-approve-texas-move-and-restore-elon-musks-56b-pay/">extra $55.8 billion</a> in compensation.</p>
<p>The problem, which affects all 3,878 Cybertrucks delivered so far, has to do with the EV's accelerator pedal. Tesla has fitted this with a metal-finish cover to match the brushed metal appearance of the truck itself—<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-why-teslas-stainless-steel-cybertrucks-may-be-rusting/">no word on whether the pedals rust, too</a>—but it says that <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V276-7026.PDF">at some point</a>, "an unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal. Residual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal."</p>
<p>Thanks to the profile of the Cybertruck's under dash, if the pedal cover becomes partially detached it can slide up and become trapped in place, wedging the pedal down and unleashing all of the Cybertruck's substantial power—the dual-motor truck boasts 600 hp (447 kW) and can reach 60 mph (98 km/h) in just over four seconds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018617#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018617&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing helped the streaming service blow past Wall Street’s earnings forecasts, but its shares fell after it said it planned to stop regularly disclosing its subscriber numbers.</p>
<p>The company’s operating income surged 54 percent in the first quarter as it added 9.3 million subscribers worldwide, proving that the efforts to reduce password sharing it launched last year have had more lasting benefits than some investors expected.</p>
<p>However, Netflix said on Thursday that from next year it would stop revealing its total number of subscribers, a metric that has been a crucial benchmark for investors in the streaming era.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018618#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018618&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, Microsoft Research Asia unveiled <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vasa-1/">VASA-1</a>, an AI model that can create a synchronized animated video of a person talking or singing from a single photo and an existing audio track. In the future, it could power virtual avatars that render locally and don't require video feeds—or allow anyone with similar tools to take a photo of a person found online and make them appear to say whatever they want.</p>

<p>"It paves the way for real-time engagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human conversational behaviors," reads the abstract of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10667">accompanying research paper</a> titled, "VASA-1: Lifelike Audio-Driven Talking Faces Generated in Real Time." It's the work of Sicheng Xu, Guojun Chen, Yu-Xiao Guo, Jiaolong Yang, Chong Li, Zhenyu Zang, Yizhong Zhang, Xin Tong, and Baining Guo.</p>
<p>The VASA framework (short for "Visual Affective Skills Animator") uses machine learning to analyze a static image along with a speech audio clip. It is then able to generate a realistic video with precise facial expressions, head movements, and lip-syncing to the audio. It does not clone or simulate voices (like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">other Microsoft research</a>) but relies on an existing audio input that could be specially recorded or spoken for a particular purpose.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018178#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018178&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.40 of the Rocket Report! There was a lot of exciting news this week. For the first time, SpaceX launched a reusable Falcon 9 booster for a 20th flight. A few miles away at Cape Canaveral, Boeing and United Launch Alliance completed one of the final steps before the first crew launch of the Starliner spacecraft. But I think one of the most interesting things that happened was NASA's decision to ask the space industry for more innovative ideas on how to do Mars Sample Return. I have no doubt that space companies will come up with some fascinating concepts, and I can't wait to hear about them.</p>

<p><b>Going vertical Down Under. </b>Gilmour Space has raised its privately developed Eris rocket vertical on a launch pad in North Queensland for the first time, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-12/australias-first-locally-made-orbital-rocket-goes-vertical/103692582?utm_source=abc_news_app&amp;utm_medium=content_shared&amp;utm_campaign=abc_news_app&amp;utm_content=link">the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports</a>. This milestone marks the start of the next phase of launch preparations for Eris, a three-stage rocket powered by hybrid engines. If successful, Eris would become the first Australian-built rocket to reach orbit. Gilmour says the maiden flight of Eris is scheduled for no earlier than May 4, pending launch permit approvals. This presumably refers to a commercial launch license from the Australian government.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018466#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018466&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
