<p><span class="lead-in-text-callout">It’s hard to</span> miss the headliners at Kew Gardens. The botanical collection in London is home to towering redwoods and giant Amazonian water lilies capable of holding up a small child. Each spring, its huge greenhouses pop with the Technicolor displays of multiple orchid species.</p>
<p class="paywall">But for the really good stuff at Kew, you have to look below the ground. Tucked underneath a laboratory at the garden’s eastern edge is the fungarium: the largest collection of fungi anywhere in the world. Nestled inside a series of green cardboard boxes are some 1.3 million specimens of fruiting bodies—the parts of the fungi that appear above ground and release spores.</p>

<p>NASA announced Friday that it will award contracts to seven companies, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, to study how to transport rock samples from Mars more cheaply back to Earth.</p>
<p>The space agency put out a call to industry in April to propose ideas on how to return the Mars rocks to Earth for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/nasa-says-it-needs-better-ideas-on-how-to-return-samples-from-mars/">less than $11 billion and before 2040</a>, the cost and schedule for NASA's existing plan for Mars Sample Return (MSR). A NASA spokesperson told Ars the agency received 48 responses to the solicitation and selected seven companies to conduct more detailed studies.</p>
<p>Each company will receive up to $1.5 million for their 90-day studies. Five of the companies chosen by NASA are among the agency's roster of large contractors, and their inclusion in the study contracts is no surprise. Two other winners are smaller businesses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029984#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029984&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Various federal and state health officials are sounding the alarm on Diamond Shruumz-brand Microdosing Chocolate Bars. The candy, said to be infused with mushrooms, has been linked to severe illnesses, including seizures, loss of consciousness, confusion, sleepiness, agitation, abnormal heart rates, hyper/hypotension, nausea, and vomiting, according to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-microdosing-chocolate-bars-june-2024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">an outbreak alert released by the Food and Drug Administration on Friday</a>.</p>
<p>So far, eight people across four states have been sickened—four in Arizona, two in Indiana, one in Nevada, and one in Pennsylvania, the FDA reported. Of the eight, six have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>"We are urging the public to use extreme caution due to the very serious effects of these products," Maureen Roland, director of the Banner Poison and Drug Information Center in Phoenix, said in <a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/newsroom/press-releases/arizona-poison-centers-warn-of-harm-from-diamond-shruumz-products">a press release earlier this week</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029953#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029953&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A critical vulnerability in the PHP programming language can be trivially exploited to execute malicious code on Windows devices, security researchers warned as they urged those affected to take action before the weekend starts.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours of the vulnerability and accompanying patch being published, researchers from the nonprofit security organization Shadowserver <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@shadowserver/112575314920464732">reported</a> Internet scans designed to identify servers that are susceptible to attacks. That—combined with (1) the ease of exploitation, (2) the availability of proof-of-concept attack code, (3) the severity of remotely executing code on vulnerable machines, and (4) the widely used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAMPP">XAMPP</a> platform being vulnerable by default—has prompted security practitioners to urge admins check to see if their PHP servers are affected before starting the weekend.</p>

<p>Google has achieved its goal of avoiding a jury trial in one antitrust case after sending a $2.3 million check to the US Department of Justice. Google will face a bench trial, a trial conducted by a judge without a jury, after a ruling today that the preemptive check is big enough to cover any damages that might have been awarded by a jury.</p>
<p>"I am satisfied that the cashier's check satisfies any damages claim," US District Judge Leonie Brinkema said after a hearing in the Eastern District of Virginia on Friday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/google-pays-us-2-3-million-for-antitrust-trial-before-judge">according to Bloomberg</a>. "A fair reading of the expert reports does not support" a higher amount, Brinkema said.</p>
<p>The check was reportedly for $2,289,751. "Because the damages are no longer part of the case, Brinkema ruled a jury is no longer needed and she will oversee the trial, set to begin in September," according to Bloomberg.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029910#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029910&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Work toward brain-computer interfaces has never been more charged. Though neuroscientists have toiled for decades to tap directly into human thoughts, recent advances have the field buzzing with anticipation—and the involvement of one polarizing billionaire has drawn a new level of attention.</p>
<p>With competition amping up in this space, Ars spoke with Ben Rapoport, who is a neurosurgeon, electrical engineer, and co-founder of the brain-computer interface (BCI) company Precision Neuroscience. Precision is at the forefront of the field, having placed its BCI on the brains of 14 human patients so far, with two more scheduled this month. Rapoport says he hopes to at least double that number of human participants by the end of this year. In fact, the 3-year-old company expects to have its first BCI on the market next year.</p>
<p>In addition to the swift progress, Precision is notable for its divergence from its competitor's strategies, namely Neuralink, the most high-profile BCI company and headed by Elon Musk. In 2016, Rapoport co-founded Neuralink alongside Musk and other scientists. But he didn't stay long and went on to co-found Precision in 2021. In previous interviews, Rapoport suggested his split from Neuralink related to the issues of safety and invasiveness of the BCI design. While Neuralink's device is going deeper into the brain—trying to eavesdrop on neuron signals with electrodes at close range to decode thoughts and intended motions and speech—Precision is staying at the surface, where there is little to no risk of damaging brain tissue.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029917#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029917&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For PC gamers used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/ars-system-mini-guide-summer-gpu-refresh-edition-aka-can-it-run-starfield/">the modular design of a desktop rig</a>, there are pros and cons to the all-in-one, pre-fab design of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">the Steam Deck</a> (and its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">many</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">subsequent</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">imitators</a> in the growing handheld gaming PC market). On the one hand, you don't have to worry about pricing out individual parts and making sure they all work together. On the other hand, the only way to upgrade one of these devices is to essentially throw out the old unit and replace the entire thing, console-style.</p>
<p>Korean computer storage-maker Adata is looking to straddle these two extremes. <a href="https://liliputing.com/adata-xpg-nia-handheld-gaming-pc-will-have-upgradeable-lpcamm2-memory-a-display-that-tilts-upward-and-a-focus-on-the-modding-community/">Lilliputing reports</a> on <a href="https://www.adata.com/us/news/1136/">Adata's XPG Nia prototype</a>, which was shown off at the Computex trade show.

<p>I fully understand why people don't want multiple game launchers on their PC. Steam is the default and good enough for (seemingly) most people. It's not your job to compel competition in the market. You want to launch and play games you enjoy, as do most of us.</p>
<p>So when I tell you that <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-midnight-suns"><em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em></a> is a game worth the hassle of registering, installing, and using the Epic Games Launcher, I am carefully picking my shot. For the price of giving Epic your email (or a proxy/relay version, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/email-protection/what-is-duckduckgo-email-protection/">like Duck</a>), or just logging in again, you can play a fun, novel, engaging turn-based strategy game, with deckbuilding and positioning tactics, for zero dollars. Even if you feel entirely sapped by Marvel at this point, like most of us, I assure you that this slice of Marvel feels more like the comic books and less like the overexposed current films. Just ask the guy who made it.</p>
<h2>Tactical deckbuilding is fun</h2>
<p>The game was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/13373/marvels-midnight-suns">very well-regarded by most critics</a> but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/firaxis-hit-by-layoffs-after-midnight-suns-disappointment-and-departure-of-iconic-creative-lead/">was not a financial success</a> upon release in December 2022, or was at least "underwhelming." Why any game hits or doesn't is a combination of many factors, but one of them was likely that the game was trying something new. It wasn't just <em>X-COM </em>with Doctor Strange. It had some <em>Fire Emblem</em> relationship-building and base exploration, but it also had cards. The cards blend into the turn-based, positional, chain-building strategy, but some people apparently saw cards and turned away.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029779#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029779&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk, back in October 2021, tweeted that “humans drive with eyes and biological neural nets, so cameras and silicon neural nets are only way to achieve generalized solution to self-driving.” The problem with his logic has been that human eyes are way better than RGB cameras at detecting fast-moving objects and estimating distances. Our brains have also surpassed all artificial neural nets by a wide margin at general processing of visual inputs.</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, a team of scientists at the University of Zurich developed a new automotive object-detection system that brings digital camera performance that’s much closer to human eyes. “Unofficial sources say Tesla uses multiple Sony IMX490 cameras with 5.4-megapixel resolution that [capture] up to 45 frames per second, which translates to perceptual latency of 22 milliseconds. Comparing [these] cameras alone to our solution, we already see a 100-fold reduction in perceptual latency,” says Daniel Gehrig, a researcher at the University of Zurich and lead author of the study.</p>
<h2>Replicating human vision</h2>
<p>When a pedestrian suddenly jumps in front of your car, multiple things have to happen before a driver-assistance system initiates emergency braking. First, the pedestrian must be captured in images taken by a camera. The time this takes is called perceptual latency—it’s a delay between the existence of a visual stimuli and its appearance in the readout from a sensor. Then, the readout needs to get to a processing unit, which adds a network latency of around 4 milliseconds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029870#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029870&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Samsung Electronics workers are on strike. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/business/samsung-first-strike-chips.html">The New York Times</a> reports, Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) has about 28,000 members, or about one-fifth of Samsung's workforce, walking out of the job on Friday. It's Samsung's first workers' strike.</p>
<p>Specifically, the walkout is in Samsung's chip division, which makes RAM, NAND flash chips, USB sticks and SD cards, Exynos processors, camera sensors, modems, NFC chips, and power and display controllers. Depending on how each quarter goes, Samsung is often the world's largest chipmaker by revenue thanks to this division, and its parts are in products from a million different brands. It's probably hard to find a tech product that doesn't have some kind of Samsung chip in it.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the union wants higher pay. Samsung's workers have gotten as much as 30 percent of their pay from bonuses, and there were no bonuses last year. UnionVP Lee Hyun Kuk told the Times that “it feels like we’ve taken a 30 percent pay cut.” The average pay for a union member is around $60,000 before bonuses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029811#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029811&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Outliers among mammals, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/02/re-re-re-thinking-the-rise-of-mammals-and-death-of-the-dinosaurs/">monotremes</a> lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Only two types of monotremes, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2008/05/platypus-genome-as-distinctive-as-its-owner/">platypus</a> and <a href="https://australian.museum/learn/animals/mammals/short-beaked-echidna/">echidna</a>, still exist, but more monotreme species were around about 100 million years ago. Some of them might possibly be even weirder than their descendants.</p>
<p>Monotreme fossils found in refuse from the opal mines of Lightning Ridge, Australia, have now revealed the opalized jawbones of three previously unknown species that lived during the Cenomanian age of the early Cretaceous. Unlike modern monotremes, these species had teeth. They also include a creature that appears to have been a mashup of a platypus and echidna—an “echidnapus.”</p>
<p>Fossil fragments of three known species from the same era were also found, meaning that at least six monotreme species coexisted in what is now Lightning Ridge. According to the researchers who unearthed these new species, the creatures may have once been as common in Australia as marsupials are today.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029837#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029837&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday, and per usual, the company is expected to detail most of the big new features in this year's updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and all of Apple's other operating systems.</p>
<p>The general consensus is that Apple plans to use this year's updates to integrate generative AI into its products for the first time. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has a few implementation details that show how Apple's approach will differ somewhat from Microsoft's or Google's.</p>

<p>Gurman says that the "Apple Intelligence" features will include an OpenAI-powered chatbot, but it will otherwise focus on "features with broad appeal" rather than "whiz-bang technology like image and video generation." These include summaries for webpages, meetings, and missed notifications; a revamped version of Siri that can control apps in a more granular way; Voice Memos transcription; image enhancement features in the Photos app; suggested replies to text messages; automated sorting of emails; and the ability to "create custom emoji characters on the fly that represent phrases or words as they're being typed."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029805#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029805&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla Board Chairperson Robyn Denholm urged shareholders to re-approve CEO Elon Musk's $46 billion pay package this week, saying the vote is "not about the money" while suggesting that Musk could leave Tesla or devote less time to the company if he isn't properly compensated.</p>
<p>"This is obviously not about the money. We all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018," Denholm wrote in a June 5 <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465924068792/tm2413800d20_defa14a.htm">letter to shareholders</a>.</p>
<p>Musk's pay plan was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/">nullified by a Delaware Court of Chancery ruling</a> in January 2024 after a lawsuit filed by a shareholder. The ruling said that Denholm had a "lackadaisical approach to her oversight obligations" and "derived the vast majority of her wealth from her compensation as a Tesla director." It also said most board members "were beholden to Musk or had compromising conflicts," and that the proxy information given to shareholders before the 2018 vote was "materially deficient."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029818#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029818&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft's upcoming Recall feature in Windows 11 has generated a wave of controversy this week following early testing that revealed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned/">huge security holes</a>. The initial version of Recall saves screenshots and a large plaintext database tracking everything that users do on their PCs, and in the current version of the feature, it's trivially easy to steal and view that database and all of those screenshots for any user on a given PC, even if you don't have administrator access. Recall also does little to nothing to redact sensitive information from its screenshots or that database.</p>

<p>Microsoft has announced that it's making some substantial changes to Recall ahead of its release on the first wave of Copilot+ PCs later this month.</p>
<p>"Even before making Recall available to customers, we have heard a clear signal that we can make it easier for people to choose to enable Recall on their Copilot+ PC and improve privacy and security safeguards," wrote Microsoft Windows and Devices Corporate Vice President Pavan Davuluri <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/">in a blog post</a>. "With that in mind we are announcing updates that will go into effect before Recall (preview) ships to customers on June 18."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029806#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029806&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>2K Games is expected to show the first trailer footage of the upcoming <em>Civilization VII</em> as part of this weekend's Summer Games Fest marketing extravaganza after a logo for the game leaked on 2K's website this morning.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed gamers at <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-leaked-in-2k-games-website.892344/">ResetEra</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1da8hse/civilization_vii_banner_up_early_in_2k_website/">Reddit</a> both <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZZHyNzS">noticed the <em>Civ VII</em> banner</a> atop the publisher's official site early this morning, alongside a "Coming Soon" label and inactive links to a trailer and wishlist page. The appearance comes just ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZzia5NrMuU">the trailer-filled Summer Games Fest livestream</a>, which will premiere at 5 pm Eastern Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>In May, the Summer Games Fest Twitter account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1da8hse/civilization_vii_banner_up_early_in_2k_website/">teased</a> that 2K would be using the event "to reveal the next iteration in one of [its] biggest and most beloved franchises." <em>Civilization VII</em> now seems primed to fill that pre-announced slot, which may be unwelcome news for fans of 2K-owned franchises like <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Bioshock</em>, and <em>NFL2K</em> (which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/2ks-new-nfl-video-game-will-be-a-non-simulation-whatever-that-means/">first publicly mulled for a revival in 2020</a>).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029786#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029786&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Have electric vehicles been overhyped? A casual observer might have come to that conclusion after almost a year of stories in the media about EVs languishing on lots and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/car-dealers-say-they-cant-sell-evs-tell-biden-to-slow-their-rollout/">letters to the White House</a> asking for a national electrification mandate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/new-epa-doe-fuel-regs-give-automakers-longer-to-reduce-co2-emissions/">to be watered down or rolled back</a>. EVs were even a pain point during last year's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/striking-uaw-workers-win-key-battery-plant-concession-from-general-motors/">auto worker industrial action</a>. But a look at the sales data paints a different picture, one where Tesla's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/tesla-sold-1-8-million-electric-vehicles-in-2023/">outsize role</a> in the market has had a distorting effect.</p>
<p>"EVs are the future. Our numbers bear that out. Current challenges will be overcome by the industry and government, and EVs will regain momentum and will ultimately dominate the automotive market," said Martin Cardell, head of global mobility solutions at consultancy firm EY.</p>
<p>Public perception hasn't been helped by recent memories of supply shortages and pandemic price gouging, but the chorus of concerns about EV sales became noticeably louder toward the end of last year and the beginning of 2024. EV sales in 2023 grew by 47 percent year on year, but the first three months of this year failed to show such massive growth. In fact, sales in Q1 2024 were up only 2.6 percent over the same period in 2023.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029773#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029773&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/broadcom-ceo-admits-vmware-changes-have-brought-unease-to-customers-partners">After acquiring VMware,</a> Broadcom swiftly enacted widespread changes that resulted in strong public backlash. A new survey of 300 director-level IT workers at companies that are customers of North American VMware provides insight into the customer reaction to Broadcom's overhaul.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cloudbolt.io/industry-research/vmware-acquisition-aftermath/">survey</a> released Thursday doesn't provide feedback from every VMware customer, but it's the first time we've seen responses from IT decision-makers working for companies paying for VMware products. It echos <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/broadcom-ceo-admits-vmware-changes-have-brought-unease-to-customers-partners/">concerns</a> expressed at the announcement of some of Broadcom's more controversial changes to VMware, like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">end of perpetual licenses</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/">growing costs</a>.</p>
<p>CloudBolt Software commissioned Wakefield Research, a market research agency, to run the study from May 9 through May 23. The "CloudBolt Industry Insights Reality Report: VMware Acquisition Aftermath" includes responses from workers at 150 companies with fewer than 1,000 workers and 150 companies with more than 1,000 workers. Survey respondents were invited via email and took the survey online, with the report authors writing that results are subject to sampling variation of ±5.7 percentage points at a 95 percent confidence level.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029533#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029533&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, still have not solved a long-running and worsening problem with leaks on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The microscopic structural cracks are located inside the small PrK module on the Russian segment of the space station, which lies between a Progress spacecraft airlock and the <em>Zvezda</em> module. After the leak rate doubled early this year during a two-week period, the Russians experimented with keeping the hatch leading to the PrK module closed intermittently and performed other investigations. But none of these measures taken during the spring worked.</p>
<p>"Following leak troubleshooting activities in April of 2024, Roscosmos has elected to keep the hatch between <em>Zvezda</em> and Progress closed when it is not needed for cargo operations," a NASA spokesperson told Ars. "Roscosmos continues to limit operations in the area and, when required for use, implements measures to minimize the risk to the International Space Station."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029436#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029436&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Artificial intelligence heavyweights in California are protesting against a state bill that would force technology companies to adhere to a strict safety framework including creating a “kill switch” to turn off their powerful AI models, in a growing battle over regulatory control of the cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>The California Legislature is considering proposals that would introduce new restrictions on tech companies operating in the state, including the three largest AI start-ups OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere as well as large language models run by Big Tech companies such as Meta.</p>
<p>The bill, passed by the state’s Senate last month and set for a vote from its general assembly in August, requires AI groups in California to guarantee to a newly created state body that they will not develop models with “a hazardous capability,” such as creating biological or nuclear weapons or aiding cyber security attacks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029734#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029734&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>There’s never been a better time to ride a weird bike.</p>
<p>That's especially true if you live in a city where you can regularly see kids being dropped off at schools from cargo bikes with buckets, child seats, and full rain covers. Further out from the urban core, fat-tire e-bikes share space on trails with three-wheelers, retro-style cruisers, and slick roadies. And folding bikes, once an obscurity, are showing up in more places, especially as they’ve gone electric.</p>
<p>So when I got to try out the <a href="https://us.brompton.com/electric-c-line">Brompton Electric C Line</a> (in a <a href="https://us.brompton.com/p/764/electric-c-line-explore">six-speed model</a>), I felt far less intimidated riding, folding, and stashing the little guy wherever I went than I might have been a few years back. A few folks recognized the distinctively small and British bike and offered a thumbs-up or light curiosity. If anyone was concerned about the oddity of this quirky ride, it was me, mostly because I obsessed over whether I could and should lock it up outside or not.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024219#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024219&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
