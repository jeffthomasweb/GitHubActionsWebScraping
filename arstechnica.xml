                            <![CDATA[<p>This has been a good week for the US space agency in terms of the federal budget.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a committee in the US House of Representatives <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/congress-moves-to-reject-bulk-of-white-houses-proposed-nasa-cuts/">passed a $24.8 billion budget bill</a> for the coming fiscal year. Then, two days later a Senate committee <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/majority/senate-committee-approves-fy-2026-commerce-justice-and-science-appropriations-bill">passed a $24.9 billion budget</a> for NASA. Both of these measures would keep funding more or less at the level of the current fiscal year and, for the most part, keep the space agency's programs going on their current trajectories.</p>
<p>These bills are not final. Both must move through the full House and Senate, and then be reconciled before going to President Trump for his signature. And time is running out, with fiscal year 2026 set to begin on October 1, just a little more than ten weeks from now.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/a-huge-fight-looms-over-the-nasa-budget-this-fall/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Polish programmer running on fumes recently accomplished what may soon become impossible: beating an advanced AI model from OpenAI in a head-to-head coding competition. The 10-hour marathon left him "completely exhausted."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, programmer Przemysław Dębiak (known as "Psyho"), a former OpenAI employee, narrowly defeated the custom AI model in the <a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/awtf2025heuristic">AtCoder World Tour Finals 2025 Heuristic contest</a> in Tokyo. AtCoder, a Japanese platform that hosts competitive programming contests and maintains global rankings, held what may be the first contest where an AI model competed directly against top human programmers in a major onsite world championship. During the event, the maker of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> participated as a sponsor and entered an AI model in a <a href="https://atcoder.jp/posts/1516">special exhibition match</a> titled "Humans vs AI." Despite the tireless nature of silicon, the company walked away with second place.</p>
<p>"Humanity has prevailed (for now!)," <a href="https://x.com/FakePsyho/status/1945444118924272018">wrote</a> Dębiak on X, noting he had little sleep while competing in several competitions across three days.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers recently reported encountering a phishing attack in the wild that bypasses a multifactor authentication scheme based on FIDO (Fast Identity Online), the industry-wide standard being adopted by thousands of sites and enterprises.</p>
<p>If true, the attack, <a href="https://expel.com/blog/poisonseed-bypassing-fido-keys-to-fetch-user-accounts/">reported in a blog post Thursday</a> by security firm Expel, would be huge news, since FIDO is widely regarded as being immune to credential phishing attacks. After analyzing the Expel write-up, I’m confident that the attack doesn’t bypass FIDO protections, at least not in the sense that the word “bypass” is commonly used in security circles. Rather, the attack downgrades the MFA process to a weaker, non-FIDO-based process. As such, the attack is better described as a FIDO downgrade attack. More about that shortly. For now, let’s describe what Expel researchers reported.</p>
<h2>Abusing cross-device sign-ins</h2>
<p>Expel said the “novel attack technique” begins with an email that links to a fake login page from Okta, a widely used authentication provider. It prompts visitors to enter their valid user name and password. People who take the bait have now helped the attack group, which Expel said is named PoisonSeed, clear the first big hurdle in gaining unauthorized access to the Okta account.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/no-phishers-are-not-bypassing-fido-mfa-at-least-not-yet-heres-why/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The series had been through multiple creative teams even before it was greenlit, but Netflix settled on two co-showrunners.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Netflix used generative AI in an original, scripted series that debuted this year, it revealed this week. Producers used the technology to create a scene in which a building collapses, hinting at the growing use of generative AI in entertainment.</p>
<p>During a call with investors yesterday, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that Netflix's Argentine show <em>The Eternaut</em>, which premiered in April, is "the very first GenAI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix, Inc. original series or film.” Sarandos further explained, per <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/07/17/netflix-nflx-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/">a transcript</a> of the call, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The creators wanted to show a building collapsing in Buenos Aires. So our iLine team, [which is the production innovation group inside the visual effects house at Netflix effects studio Scanline], partnered with their creative team using AI-powered tools. ... And in fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with visual, traditional VFX tools and workflows. And, also, the cost of it would just not have been feasible for a show in that budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarandos claimed that viewers have been "thrilled with the results"; although that likely has much to do with how the rest of the series, based on a comic, plays out, not just one, AI-crafted scene.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/netflixs-first-show-with-generative-ai-is-a-sign-of-whats-to-come-in-tv-film/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, a federal court in Miami started hearing a wrongful death case involving Tesla's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/teslas-using-autopilot-crashed-273-times-in-less-than-a-year/">crash-prone</a> Autopilot driver assistance system. It's not the first time that Tesla Autopilot has been implicated in fatal traffic crashes, but it is the first time that a federal court has heard such a case.</p>
<p>Until now, the most high-profile court case involving Tesla Autopilot was probably the California trial over the death of Walter Huang, who was killed in 2018 when his Tesla Model X steered itself into a concrete highway divider. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-goes-on-trial-for-apple-engineers-fatal-2018-autopilot-crash/">Huang's family took Tesla to court</a> in April 2024 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-settles-autopilot-wrongful-death-suit-avoiding-court-trial/">but quickly settled with the automaker</a> under terms that have been kept secret.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ttnews.com/articles/tesla-settles-truck-fatal-crash">And earlier this week,</a> Tesla settled another Autopilot lawsuit concerning the death of Jeremy Banner in 2019. In that case, the Tesla's sensors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/05/feds-autopilot-was-active-during-deadly-march-tesla-crash/">failed to recognize a tractor-trailer crossing the highway</a> and collided with it, shearing the top off the car and killing Banner.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/experts-lay-into-tesla-safety-in-federal-autopilot-trial/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nearly 800,000 doses of mpox vaccine pledged to African countries working to stamp out devastating outbreaks are headed for the waste bin because they weren't shipped in time, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/17/us-has-wasted-hundreds-of-thousands-of-vaccines-meant-for-africa-health-officials-there-say-00460290?utm_campaign=KHN:+First+Edition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--eszRHhuI8X2faI-mZVE2luzzBgtK1oFhRnCmThGQYTOQfpxJ6mH-8hqkNJJl3U2D6dRENrJ8VXScM47-IJLTksbKauA&amp;_hsmi=371897914&amp;utm_content=371897914&amp;utm_source=hs_email">according to reporting by Politico</a>.</p>
<p>The nearly 800,000 doses were part of a donation promised under the Biden administration, which was meant to deliver more than 1 million doses. Overall, the US, the European Union, and Japan pledged to collectively provide 5 million doses to nearly a dozen African countries. The US has only sent 91,000 doses so far, and only 220,000 currently still have enough shelf life to make it. The rest are expiring within six months, making them ineligible for shipping.</p>
<p>"For a vaccine to be shipped to a country, we need a minimum of six months before expiration to ensure that the vaccine can arrive in good condition and also allow the country to implement the vaccination," Yap Boum, an Africa CDC deputy incident manager, told Politico.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/trump-admin-squanders-nearly-800000-vaccines-meant-for-africa-report/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge ruled yesterday that President Trump violated US law when he fired Democrat Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her position at the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>"Because the law on the removal of FTC Commissioners is clear, and for the reasons explained below, the court will grant Ms. Slaughter's motion for summary judgment and deny Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278902/gov.uscourts.dcd.278902.51.0_1.pdf">memorandum opinion</a> from Judge Loren AliKhan in US District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>

The case could end up at the Supreme Court, with the Trump administration seeking to overturn a 1935 precedent that AliKhan cited while ruling in Slaughter's favor.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/court-rules-trump-broke-us-law-when-he-fired-democratic-ftc-commissioner/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In January, YouTuber Jon Prosser posted a video to his Front Page Tech channel that claimed to be “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">your very first look at iOS 19</a>,” the operating system that Apple would announce as iOS 26 a few months later.</p>
<p>Though Prosser claimed he “could not show the real video of what I saw” because he wanted to protect his source, the rest of the video showed a mock-up for a redesigned version of the Camera app, which ended up being a preview of the company-wide “Liquid Glass” redesign that Apple would show off at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June (Prosser also posted more extensive iOS 19 previews in April, including one labeled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGI8sZqWEl0">the biggest iOS leak ever</a>.”)</p>
<p>Months after the fact, Apple confirmed that Prosser got an early look at the new OS and the Liquid Glass design. It did so by suing Prosser and a man named Michael Ramacciotti for leaking Apple’s trade secrets (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/apple-sues-jon-prosser-ios-26-leaks/">as reported by MacRumors</a>).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/apple-sues-youtuber-who-leaked-ios-26s-new-liquid-glass-software-redesign/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sixty thousand years ago, two groups of Neanderthals lived just a stone’s throw apart in what’s now northern Israel. But they had very different <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/hand-me-that-flint-flake-archaeologists-butcher-cook-fowl-like-a-neanderthal/">cultures when it came to food</a>, according to a recent study. Archaeologist Anaëlle Jallon of Hebrew University of Jerusalem and her colleagues examined dozens of animal bones from both sites, looking for clues about Neanderthal meal prep. It turns out that something as mundane as the cut marks left by butchering an animal can reveal differences in ancient people’s way of life.</p>

<h2><b>What did Neanderthals eat? It depends.</b></h2>
<p>The Neanderthals who lived around the Sea of Galilee between 70,000 and 50,000 years ago had their pick of meat entrees on the hoof. The area was home to several species of deer, from tiny roe deer to larger red deer, along with gazelles, wild goats, boar, and larger game like aurochs and relatives of modern horses. For Neanderthal hunters equipped with wood and stone hunting tools, the place was a veritable buffet. And you might expect that one group of Neanderthals would eat pretty much the same things as any others in the area.</p>
<p>However, what Jallon and her colleagues found in their recent study looks more like the Pleistocene version of New York and Chicago having very different styles of pizza: same ingredients, different ways of using them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/local-cuisine-was-on-the-menu-at-cafe-neanderthal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is expected to sign the GENIUS Act into law Friday, securing his first big win as a self-described "pro-crypto president." The act is the first major piece of cryptocurrency legislation passed in the US.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives voted to pass the GENIUS Act on Thursday, approving the same bill that the Senate passed last month. The law provides a federal framework for stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that's considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, as each token is backed by the US dollar or other supposedly low-risk assets.</p>
<p>The GENIUS Act is expected to spur more widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, since stablecoins are often used to move funds between different tokens. It could become a gateway for many Americans who are otherwise shy about investing in cryptocurrencies, which is what the industry wants. Ahead of Thursday's vote, critics had warned that Republicans were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/trumps-stablecoin-push-will-open-floodgates-to-massive-fraud-lawmaker-warns/">rushing the pro-industry bill without ensuring adequate consumer protections</a>, though, seemingly setting Americans up to embrace stablecoins as legitimate so-called "cash of the blockchain" without actually insuring their investments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/stablecoin-bill-heads-to-trumps-desk-without-blocks-on-presidential-grifting/">Read full article</a></p>

But it is critical that European policymakers make strategic investments across the industry or companies like PLD Space, which outlined big plans this week, will struggle to get off the launch pad.</p>

Its tools have been quirky designs and glowing lights, along with a focus on markets outside the US. With the Nothing Phone 3, the company has brought its "first flagship" phone stateside.</p>
<p>Nothing didn't swing for the fences with the Phone 3's specs, but this device can hold its own with the likes of OnePlus and Google. Plus, it has that funky Nothing design aesthetic. There's a transparent back, a tiny dot matrix screen, and a comprehensive Android skin. But at the end of the day, the Nothing Phone 3 is not treading new ground.</p>
<h2>Designing Nothing</h2>
<p>Despite Nothing's talk about unique designs, the Nothing Phone 3 looks unremarkable from the front. The bezels are slim and symmetrical all the way around the screen. Under a sheet of Gorilla Glass 7i, it has a 6.67-inch 120Hz OLED screen with an impressive 1260 x 2800 resolution. It hits 4,500 nits of brightness, which is even higher than Google and Samsung phones (we're not seeing much difference in practice). It's more than bright enough to be readable outdoors, and the touch sensitivity is excellent—sometimes <em>too</em> excellent, as we've noticed a few accidental edge touches.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/nothing-phone-3-review-nothing-ventured-nothing-gained/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>San Diego Comic-Con is coming up next week, and Disney is getting ready for its big presentation by releasing a new trailer for <em>TRON: Ares</em>, directed by Joachim Rønning.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for<em> TRON: Legacy</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/go-back-to-the-grid-in-tron-ares-trailer/">previously reported</a>, <em>TRON: Legacy</em> ended with Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), son of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) from the original film, preventing the digital world from bleeding into the real world, as planned by the Grid's malevolent ruling program, Clu. He brought with him Quorra (Olivia Wilde), a naturally occurring isomorphic algorithm targeted for extinction by Clu.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/jared-leto-is-the-ultimate-solder-in-new-tron-ares-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Late Tuesday, President Trump announced on social media that he had convinced Coca-Cola to agree to use "REAL Cane Sugar" in Coke, in lieu of the current, cheaper sweetener used in the US version of the drink: high-fructose corn syrup.</p>
<p>"I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them—You’ll see. It's just better!" <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114864763487869986">Trump wrote</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Coca-Cola failed to confirm that supposed agreement. On its website, the beverage giant posted a <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/coca-cola-product-range.html">brief, vague statement</a> saying "We appreciate President Trump’s enthusiasm for our iconic Coca‑Cola brand" and that "More details on new innovative offerings" will be announced soon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/trumps-claims-of-a-coca-cola-agreement-quickly-go-flat-as-nutritionists-groan/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Dictionary.com offers a free dictionary through its website and free Android and iOS apps. It used to offer paid-for mobile apps, called Dictionary.com Pro, that let users set up accounts, use the app without ads, and enabled other features (like grammar tips and science and rhyming dictionaries) that are gone now. Dictionary.com's premium apps also let people download an offline dictionary (its free apps used to let you buy a downloadable dictionary as a one-time purchase), but offline the dictionaries aren't available anymore.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers from Cisco’s Talos security team have uncovered a malware-as-a-service operator that used public GitHub accounts as a channel for distributing an assortment of malicious software to targets.</p>
<p>The use of GitHub gave the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) a reliable and easy-to-use platform that’s greenlit in many enterprise networks that rely on the code repository for the software they develop. GitHub removed the three accounts that hosted the malicious payloads shortly after being notified by Talos.</p>
<p>“In addition to being an easy means of file hosting, downloading files from a GitHub repository may bypass Web filtering that is not configured to block the GitHub domain,” Talos researchers Chris Neal and Craig Jackson <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/maas-operation-using-emmenhtal-and-amadey-linked-to-threats-against-ukrainian-entities/">wrote Thursday</a>. “While some organizations can block GitHub in their environment to curb the use of open-source offensive tooling and other malware, many organizations with software development teams require GitHub access in some capacity. In these environments, a malicious GitHub download may be difficult to differentiate from regular web traffic.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/malware-as-a-service-caught-using-github-to-distribute-its-payloads/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you're the owner of an Android phone and live in a seismically active region, there's a chance your phone has popped up an unusual warning. Not one that asks for permission to share personal information, or potential malware, but something far more serious: There's an earthquake nearby, and you have up to a minute or two to get to a safer location.</p>
<p>Starting in the US in 2020 and expanding internationally since, the system is called Android Earthquake Alert (AEA), and it's on by default in most Android phones. And today, Google has a paper in Science that describes how the system works, how the company has improved it, and what it has seen during the first few years of operation, including what caused a handful of false alarms.</p>
<h2>Shaking things up</h2>
<p>Smartphones come with accelerometers, small devices that enable them to sense changes in motion. This is how they manage to do tricks like figuring out how many steps you're walking. If your phone is sitting quietly on a table, however, the accelerometer shouldn't be registering much significant motion. But anything from you walking across the room to a truck going by outside can cause vibrations that your phone's accelerometer can pick up. As can the often less subtle vibrations of earthquakes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/how-android-phones-became-an-earthquake-warning-system/">Read full article</a></p>
