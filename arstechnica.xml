                            <![CDATA[<p>When Hurricane Helene ravaged western North Carolina in September 2024, one of its many victims was a manufacturing plant that made intravenous fluids. The sterile IV solutions produced in the plant are essential supplies for hospitals and other medical facilities, which use them in various treatments, from rehydration to drug delivery and kidney dialysis. And the plant damaged by Helene—Baxter International's North Cove manufacturing facility in Marion—didn't just make <em>some</em> of the US supply; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/helene-ravaged-the-nc-plant-that-makes-60-of-the-countrys-iv-fluid-supply/">it made 60 percent</a>.</p>
<p>With the Baxter plant down, hospitals around the country began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/as-hospitals-struggle-with-iv-fluid-shortage-nc-plant-restarts-production/">rationing supplies</a>. They changed treatment strategies and, in some cases, canceled or delayed surgeries. In one poll, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/over-86-of-surveyed-health-care-providers-are-short-on-iv-fluids/">over 86 percent</a> of health care providers said they were affected by the nationwide shortage. The federal government, for its part, loosened importation rules and granted extensions to expiration dates to offer some relief from the dire shortage.</p>
<p>This secondary emergency was yet another reminder of just how fragile the US drug supply chain has become. Just months before the catastrophic hurricane in North Carolina, drug shortages in the US reached an all-time high, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/us-drug-shortages-reach-record-high-with-323-meds-now-in-short-supply/">323 active and ongoing shortages</a>. Although they've fallen since then, they remain high, with shortages in the first quarter of this year at <a href="https://www.ashp.org/drug-shortages/shortage-resources/drug-shortages-statistics?loginreturnUrl=SSOCheckOnly">253</a>, according to data collected by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/most-us-drug-facilities-are-in-areas-hit-by-natural-disasters-risking-shortages/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At first glance, Nam-Joon Cho’s lab at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University looks like your typical research facility—scientists toiling away, crowded workbenches, a hum of machinery in the background. But the orange-yellow stains on the lab coats slung on hooks hint at a less-usual subject matter under study.</p>
<p>The powdery stain is pollen: microscopic grains containing male reproductive cells that trees, weeds, and grasses release seasonally. But Cho isn’t studying irksome effects like hay fever, or what pollen means for the plants that make it. Instead, the material scientist has spent a decade pioneering and refining techniques to remodel pollen’s rigid outer shell—made of a polymer so tough it’s sometimes called <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-diamond-of-the-plant-world-helped-land-plants-evolve-20220719/">“the diamond of the plant world”</a>—transforming the grains to a jam-like consistency.</p>
<p>This microgel, Cho believes, could be a versatile building block for many eco-friendly materials, including paper, film, and sponges.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/using-pollen-to-make-paper-sponges-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After the Trump administration confirmed a rumor that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/us-may-purchase-stake-in-intel-after-trump-attacked-ceo/">US is planning to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel</a>, US Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came forward Wednesday to voice support for the highly unusual plan, finding rare common ground with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the plan would see the US disbursing approved CHIPS Act grants only after acquiring non-voting shares of Intel and likely other chipmakers. That would allow the US to profit off its investment in chipmakers, Lutnick suggested, and Sanders <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-sanders-favors-trump-plan-take-stake-intel-others-2025-08-20/">told Reuters</a> that he agreed American taxpayers could benefit from the potential deals.</p>
<p>"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment," Sanders said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/bernie-sanders-backs-trumps-plan-to-buy-stake-in-intel/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When updating a piece of software as large and complex and old as Windows, you're inevitably going to break something every once in a while. Microsoft tracks known issues <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-23h2#3640msgdesc">here</a>—generally they affect lesser-used features or obscure edge cases, but every once in a while you run into something bigger and more disruptive.</p>
<p>August's updates have introduced a couple of more noticeable problems. The first was caused by <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-12-2025-kb5063875-os-builds-22621-5768-and-22631-5768-c67aac47-127c-4bd1-b92d-ebd9093f031d">update KB5063875</a>, a relatively minor security update for older versions of Windows 10 and 11. This update broke Windows' built-in reset and recovery features, used to restore a Windows installation to its factory defaults if you're experiencing a problem or are planning on handing down or otherwise getting rid of your PC. After installing the update, users of Windows 11 23H2 and 22H2 and Windows 10 22H2 who tried to reset their PCs would see the process silently fail with no explanation.</p>
<p>Microsoft quickly resolved this one with update KB5066189—the issue was opened on August 18 and marked as resolved on August 19—so if you're still having issues, check for the update that will fix your update.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/having-recovery-and-or-ssd-problems-after-recent-windows-updates-youre-not-alone/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Ant eating is widely distributed across mammalian lineages.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>If you were to design the strangest diet possible, eating nothing but ants and termites would probably make the shortlist. Yet over the past 66 million years, mammals across the globe have repeatedly gone down this path—not once or twice, but at least a dozen times. From anteaters and aardvarks to pangolins and aardwolves, the so-called myrmecophages (animals that feed on ants and termites) have evolved similar traits: they’ve lost most or all of their teeth, grown long sticky tongues, and learned to consume insects by the tens to hundreds of thousands each day.</p>
<p>A new study reveals that this extreme dietary specialization, once thought rare and mysterious, has emerged independently in mammals at least 12 times in the last 66 million years (i.e., since the Cenozoic era began). This is a striking <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/01/red-and-giant-pandas-share-similarities-at-the-gene-level-too/">example of convergent evolution</a> and shows just how powerful ants and termites have been in shaping mammalian history.</p>
<p>“The number of distinct origins for myrmecophagy was certainly surprising, as was the discovery that their origins seem to quite neatly follow the trend of growth across ant and termite colony sizes throughout the Cenozoic,” Thomas Vida, first author of the study and a researcher at the University of Bonn, told Ars Technica.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/mammals-that-chose-ants-and-termites-as-food-almost-never-go-back/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>US defense officials have long worried that China's Guowang satellite network might give the Chinese military access to the kind of ubiquitous connectivity US forces now enjoy with SpaceX's Starlink network.</p>
<p>It turns out the Guowang constellation could offer a lot more than a homemade Chinese alternative to Starlink's high-speed consumer-grade broadband service. China has disclosed little information about the Guowang network, but there's mounting evidence that the satellites may provide Chinese military forces a tactical edge in any future armed conflict in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>The megaconstellation is managed by a secretive company called China SatNet, which was established by the Chinese government in 2021. SatNet has released little information since its formation, and the group doesn't have a website. Chinese officials have not detailed any of the satellites' capabilities or signaled any intention to market the services to consumers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/china-may-have-taken-an-early-lead-in-the-race-for-a-military-megaconstellation/">Read full article</a></p>

Pricing for all current versions of the PlayStation 5 console will increase by $50 starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>The price of the PS5 Digital Edition will increase from $450 to $500; the standard PS5 will increase from $500 to $550; and the PS5 Pro will increase from $700 to $750. If you've been on the fence about buying any of these, retailers like Target and Best Buy are still using the old prices as of this writing—for other console price hikes, retailers have sometimes bumped the prices up before the date announced by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>"Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment," wrote Sony Global Marketing VP Isabelle Tomatis. "As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/sony-joins-xbox-and-nintendo-in-hiking-playstation-5-prices-in-the-us/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has shifted its product timeline in 2025. Android 16 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/android-16-begins-rolling-out-today-to-pixel-devices.1507822/">dropped in May</a>, an earlier release aimed at better lining up with smartphone launches. Google's annual hardware refresh is also happening a bit ahead of the traditional October window. The company has unveiled its thoroughly leaked 2025 Pixel phones and watches, and you can preorder most of them today.</p>
<p>The new Pixel 10 phones don't look much different from last year, but there's an assortment of notable internal changes, and you might not like all of them. They have a new, more powerful Tensor chip (good), a lot more AI features (debatable), and no SIM card slot (bad). But at least the new Pixel Watch 4 won't become e-waste if you break it.</p>
<h2>Same on the outside, new on the inside</h2>
<p>If you liked Google's big Pixel redesign last year, there's good news: Nothing has changed in 2025. The Pixel 10 series looks the same, right down to the almost identical physical dimensions. Aside from the new colors, the only substantial design change is the larger camera window on the Pixel 10 to accommodate the addition of a third sensor.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-unveils-pixel-10-series-with-improved-tensor-g5-chip-and-a-boatload-of-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Asus and Microsoft will be launching their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">ROG Xbox Ally series of handheld gaming PCs</a> starting October 16, according to an Asus announcement that went out today.</p>
<p>An Xbox-branded extension of Asus' existing ROG Ally handheld line, the basic ROG Xbox Ally and more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X, both run a version of Windows 11 Home that's been redesigned with a controller-first Xbox-style user interface. The idea is to preserve the wide game compatibility of Windows—and the wide compatibility with multiple storefronts, including Microsoft's own, Valve's Steam, the Epic Games Store, and more—while turning off all of the extra Windows desktop stuff and saving system resources. (This also means that, despite the Xbox branding, these handhelds play Windows PC games and not the Xbox versions.)</p>
<p>Microsoft and Asus initially announced the handhelds in June. Microsoft still isn't sharing pricing information for either console, so it's hard to say how their specs and features will stack up against the Steam Deck (starting at $399 for the LCD version, $549 for OLED), Nintendo's Switch 2 ($450), or past Asus handhelds like the ROG Ally X ($800).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/asus-and-microsofts-xbox-handhelds-arrive-october-16-but-pricing-remains-a-mystery/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a clear rebuke to US health secretary and zealous anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., <a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32835/AAP-releases-evidence-based-immunization-schedule?searchresult=1">the American Academy of Pediatrics on Tuesday</a> released its own <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf">evidence-based vaccination schedule for children</a>—a task typically left to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its trusted advisory committee.</p>
<p>The AAP has been among the most assertive medical groups to push back on the anti-vaccine tactics and actions Kennedy has undertaken as the country's top health official. Those include spreading misinformation about lifesaving vaccines; firing all 17 esteemed CDC vaccine advisors under <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2837784">the false pretense that they had disqualifying conflicts of interest</a>; replacing those advisors with unqualified committee members who share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views; and unilaterally restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines without any evidence-based explanation.</p>
<p>Prior to the release of the vaccine schedule, the AAP boycotted the first meeting of Kennedy's hand-selected CDC vaccine advisors in June, saying the committee's work is "<a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32529/AAP-will-continue-to-publish-its-own-vaccine">no longer a credible process</a>." In July, the organization <a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32580">filed a lawsuit</a>—alongside other medical groups—against the US health department over Kennedy's changes to the federal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/top-pediatricians-buck-rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-meddling-on-covid-shot-guidance/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Prime Video has dropped an extended teaser for the much-anticipated second season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(American_TV_series)"><em>Fallout</em></a>, widely considered to be among the best TV adaptations of a gaming franchise. In our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/tv-technica-2024-our-picks-for-the-best-of-tv/">2024 year-end roundup</a>, Ars senior editor Samuel Axon wrote that the first season gave us "a specific cocktail of tongue-in-cheek humor, sci-fi campiness, strong themes, great characters, and visceral violence [that] came together into a fantastic show." The second season looks like it will bring us more of the same, along with a major new character drawn from the <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> game. We even got a glimpse of a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw">Deathclaw</a>.</p>
<p><strong>(Minor spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Fallout</em> is set two centuries after nuclear warfare between the US and China destroyed civilization in 2077—an alternate history version of 2077, in which post-World War II nuclear technology ushered in a retrofuturistic society. Some lucky survivors took refuge in various underground vaults; others were left to scavenge a meager existence on the highly radioactive surface.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/fallout-s2-teaser-brings-us-to-new-vegas/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Apple enthusiast publication 9to5Mac "found multiple references to built-in support for Anthropic accounts," including in the "Intelligence" menu, where users can currently log in to ChatGPT or enter an API key for higher message limits.</p>
<p>Apple introduced a suite of features meant to compete with GitHub Copilot in Xcode at WWDC24, but first focused on its own models and a more limited set of use cases. That expanded quite a bit at this year's developer conference, and users can converse about codebases, discuss changes, or ask for suggestions using ChatGPT. They are initially given a limited set of messages, but this can be greatly increased by logging in to a ChatGPT account or entering an API key.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/in-xcode-26-apple-shows-first-signs-of-offering-chatgpt-alternatives/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Starlink operator SpaceX is continuing its fight against state plans to expand fiber broadband availability. After saying the Trump administration should <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-tries-to-block-virginias-plan-to-bring-fiber-internet-to-residents/">deny a Virginia proposal</a>, SpaceX is taking the same approach in a fight against Louisiana.</p>
<p>SpaceX made its view known to the Louisiana Office of Broadband Development and Connectivity in <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SpaceX-Comments-to-Lousiana-Draft-Final-Proposal-Final.pdf">a filing</a>, which was <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-starlink-also-protests-louisiana-bead-broadband-fiber-plans">reported yesterday</a> by PCMag. SpaceX complained that Louisiana proposed awarding 91.5 percent of funds to fiber Internet service providers instead of to the Starlink satellite system. SpaceX alleged that Louisiana was influenced by "a legion of fiber lobbyists and other hangers-on seeking to personally benefit from massive taxpayer spending."</p>
<p>The Trump administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/">rewrote rules</a> for the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program in a way that benefits Starlink. Instead of prioritizing fiber networks that offer better service and are more future-proof, the Trump administration ordered states to revise their plans with a "tech-neutral approach" and lower the average cost of serving each location.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-keeps-trying-to-block-fiber-deployment-says-us-must-nix-louisiana-plan/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ancient rituals and customs often leave behind obvious archaeological evidence. From the impeccably preserved mummies of Egypt to psychoactive substance residue that remained <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78721-8">at the bottom of a clay vessel</a> for thousands of years, it seems as if some remnants of the past, even if not all are immediately visible, have defied the ravages of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://world.thaipbs.or.th/detail/betel-chewing-a-tradition-that-has-seen-better-days/56675">Chewing betel nuts</a> is a cultural practice in parts of Southeast Asia. When chewed, these reddish nuts, which are the fruit of the areca palm, release psychoactive compounds that heighten alertness and energy, promote feelings of euphoria, and help with relaxation. They are usually wrapped in betel leaves with lime paste made from powdered shells or corals, depending on the region.</p>
<p>Critically, the ancient teeth from betel nut chewers are distinguishable because of red staining. So when archaeologist Piyawit Moonkham, of Chiang Mai University in Thailand, unearthed 4,000-year-old skeletons from the Bronze Age burial site of Nong Ratchawat, the lack of telltale red stains appeared to indicate that the individuals they belonged to were not chewers of betel nuts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/ancient-teeth-show-people-were-getting-high-off-betel-nuts-4000-years-ago/">Read full article</a></p>

The agency says it has been more than 42 days since a new case was reported in any of the counties that previously showed evidence of ongoing transmission.</p>
<p>The outbreak has contributed to the worst year for measles cases in the United States in more than 30 years. As of August 5, the most recent update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 1,356 confirmed measles cases <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html">have been reported across the country this year</a>. For comparison, there were just 285 measles cases in 2024.</p>
<p>The Texas outbreak began in January in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates. More than two-thirds of the state’s reported cases were in children, and two children in Texas died of the virus. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Over the course of the outbreak, a total of 99 people were hospitalized, representing 13 percent of cases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/the-west-texas-measles-outbreak-has-ended/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's pretty obvious at this point that the Trump administration is waging a full-scale assault on US science. It has proposed budgets that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trumps-2026-budget-proposal-crippling-cuts-for-science-across-the-board/">would be catastrophic</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trump-administration-cuts-off-all-future-federal-funding-to-harvard/">stopped the flow of research funds</a> to a number of universities, and sought to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/new-executive-order-puts-all-grants-under-political-control/">exert unprecedented political control</a> over what funding is distributed. Money has been <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-director-orders-new-review-grants-outline-top-research-priorities">repeatedly delayed</a> as grants have been checked and rechecked <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/10/vaccines-nih-rfk-research-canceled/">for ideological issues</a>. And all of that is before we get to the instances where the administration has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/trump-annoyed-the-smithsonian-isnt-promoting-discredited-racial-ideas/">attempted to undermine</a> specific <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/analysis-the-trump-administrations-assault-on-climate-action/">scientific results</a>.</p>
<p>But, somewhat unexpectedly, everything isn't currently dark for US-based scientists, as recent budget appropriations in the Senate have ignored Trump's requests (and budget guidance passed by the Senate itself) and have <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/boost-nih-budget-senate-panel-rejects-trump-s-plan-slash-agency">funded research at levels similar to previous years</a>. That funding may ultimately set up a confrontation between a Congress that wants to fund science, and a president who has little interest in doing so—a confrontation the administration appears to be preparing for.</p>
<h2>Project 2025 and science</h2>
<p>The president himself appears to be completely indifferent to science, being willing to simply <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/04/trumps-faulty-wind-power-claims/">make things up as needed</a>, with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66928305">no regard for evidence</a>. Instead, most of the attacks on research funding have come from a combination of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The latter is helmed by Russell Vought, who helped produce the Project 2025 document that outlined many of the actions taken by the new administration.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/analysis-funding-science-at-past-levels-is-only-half-the-battle/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The UK has dropped its demand that Apple create a backdoor for government security officials to access encrypted data, according to US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.</p>
<p>Gabbard wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/DNIGabbard/status/1957623737232007638">post on X</a> last night that she has "been working closely with our partners in the UK... to ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected. As a result, the UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties."</p>
<p>Reports <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/uk-demands-apple-break-encryption-to-allow-govt-spying-worldwide-reports-say/">surfaced in February</a> that the UK served Apple with a secret order, known as a Technical Capability Notice, under its Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) or so-called "Snoopers' Charter." Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/apple-appeals-uks-secret-demand-for-backdoor-access-to-encrypted-user-data/">appealed the order</a> and refused to break its end-to-end encryption, opting instead to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/apple-pulls-data-protection-tool-instead-of-caving-to-uk-demand-for-a-backdoor/">remove iCloud's Advanced Data Protection feature</a> from the UK market.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/trump-admin-says-it-convinced-uk-to-drop-demand-for-apple-backdoor/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Serious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton">badminton</a> players are constantly exploring different techniques to give them an edge over opponents. One of the latest innovations is the spin serve, a devastatingly effective method in which a player adds a pre-spin just before the racket contacts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttlecock">shuttlecock</a> (aka the birdie). It's so effective—some have called it "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJiIigfOKkA">impossible to return</a>"—that the Badminton World Federation (BWF) banned the spin serve in 2023, at least until after the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris.</p>
<p>The sanction wasn't meant to quash innovation but to address players' concerns about the possible unfair advantages the spin serve conferred. The BWF thought that international tournaments shouldn't become the test bed for the technique, which is markedly similar to the previously banned "Sidek serve." The BWF <a href="https://corporate.bwfbadminton.com/news-single/2025/05/02/updates-to-bwf-laws-and-regulations-2">permanently banned</a> the spin serve earlier this year. Chinese physicists have now teased out the complex fundamental physics of the spin serve, <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/37/8/087179/3359548/Shuttlecock-trajectory-during-spin-serves?redirectedFrom=fulltext">publishing their findings</a> in the journal Physics of Fluids.</p>
<p>Shuttlecocks are unique among the various projectiles used in different sports due to their open conical shape. Sixteen overlapping feathers protrude from a rounded cork base that is usually covered in thin leather. The birdies one uses for leisurely backyard play might be synthetic nylon, but serious players prefer actual feathers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/physics-of-badmintons-new-killer-spin-serve/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There's a new Nissan Leaf coming later this year. The third of its kind to bear the name, it sounds like an appealing upgrade. Smaller than the current model on the outside but with more room inside, it's also more efficient and finally uses a liquid-cooled battery. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/everything-we-know-about-the-2026-nissan-leaf/">But we knew all that back at the start of summer</a>. What we didn't know then was how much the Leaf will cost.</p>
<p>As we noted back in June, pricing is most likely to determine the Leaf's success or failure. None of the improvements to this electric vehicle will matter if it's too expensive. Happily, that doesn't appear to be the case. The Leaf S+ is the base model, with a 75 kWh long-range battery and a range of 303 miles (487 km)—it will cost $29,990 when it goes on sale this fall.</p>
<p>That makes it cheaper than the original car when it first went on sale back in 2011, and that's before taking inflation into account. "We've stuck to our mission of engineering EVs that are affordable but packed with value. That's how we've kept the LEAF's price steady over three generations—all while giving owners more style, more technology, more features and a vastly improved driving range over the original 2011 model," said Nissan Senior Vice President of US Marketing and Sales Vinay Shahani.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/nissan-announces-2026-leaf-pricing-starting-at-29990/">Read full article</a></p>
