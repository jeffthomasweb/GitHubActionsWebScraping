              <![CDATA[<p>The rocket was there. And then it decidedly was <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>Shortly after sunrise on a late summer morning nearly nine years ago at SpaceX's sole operational launch pad, engineers neared the end of a static fire test. These were still early days for their operation of a Falcon 9 rocket that used super-chilled liquid propellants, and engineers pressed to see how quickly they could complete fueling. This was because the liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel warmed quickly in Florida's sultry air, and cold propellants were essential to maximizing the rocket's performance.</p>
<p>On this morning, September 1, 2016, everything proceeded more or less nominally up until eight minutes before the ignition of the rocket's nine Merlin engines. It was a stable point in the countdown, so no one expected what happened next.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-pushed-sniper-theory-with-the-feds-far-more-than-is-publicly-known/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Plus: Kyle and Andrew discuss '80s pop covers and free jazz. No, seriously...]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here after they air</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: We start this episode from the perspective of a band of highly armed FEDRA agents in 2018 Seattle, shooting the shit in a transport that somehow still has usable gasoline. Maybe it's just the political moment we're in, but I was not quite emotionally prepared for these militarized characters in my post-apocalyptic escape show to start casually using "voters" as an ironic signifier for regular people.</p>
<p>"LOL, like we'd ever let them vote, amirite?"</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: We've spent so little time with FEDRA—the post-collapse remnant of what had once been the US government—since the very opening episodes of the show that you can forget exactly why nearly every other individual and organization in the show's world hates it and wants nothing to do with it. But here's a reminder for us: casual cruelty, performed by ignorant fascists.</p>
<p>Of course as soon as you see and hear Jeffrey Wright, you know he's going to be A Guy (he's an HBO alum from <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> and <em>Westworld</em>, among many, many other film, TV, vocal, and stage performances). He just as casually betrays and blows up the transport full of jumped-up FEDRA jarheads, which is a clear prestige TV storytelling signifier. Here is a Man With A Code, but also a Man To Be Feared.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, Isaac's backstory was only broadly hinted at in the games, so getting to see this big "Who This Character Is" moment in the show was pretty effective.</p>
<p>What I found less effective was Ellie playing a very able A-Ha cover when she discovers the abandoned guitar room. In the game it serves as a welcome change of pace from a lot of frenetic action, and a good excuse for an endearing guitar-playing mini-game. Here it felt like it just kind of dragged on, with a lot of awkward dwelling on close-ups of Dina's creepily enamored face.</p>

<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: You know what, though, I do appreciate that the show at least made an effort to explain why this 30-year-old guitar was still in pristine condition. I don't <em>instantly</em> buy that the silica gel packets (which Ellie, wisely, does not eat) in the guitar case would have lasted for that long, but at least she didn't pull a mossy guitar straight off the wall and start tuning it up. Those strings are gonna corrode! That neck is gonna warp!</p>
<p>I do also think the show (and the game, I guess, picking up your context clues) got away with picking one of the goofiest songs they possibly could that would still read as "soulful and emotionally resonant" when played solo on acoustic guitar. But I suppose that's always been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c745E7T_Wvg">the power of that particular instrument</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Both the game and the show have leaned heavily on the '80s nostalgia that Joel passed on to Ellie, and as a child of the '80s, I'll be damned if I said it doesn't work on me on that level.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: It's also, for what it's worth, exactly what a beginner-to-intermediate guitar player is going to know how to do. If I find a guitar during an apocalypse, all people are going to be able to get out of me are mid-2000s radio singles with easy chord progressions. It's too bad that society didn't last long enough in this reality to produce "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Not to cut short "Guitar Talk," but the show cuts it off with a creepy scene of Isaac talking about high-end cookware to an initially unseen companion on the floor. The resulting scene of torture is, for my money, way worse than most anything we're exposed to in the games—and these are games that are not exactly squeamish about showing scenes of torture and extreme violence!</p>
<p>Felt to me like they're taking advantage of HBO's reputation for graphic content just because they could, here...</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Definitely gratuitous! But not totally without storytelling utility. I do think, if you're setting Isaac up to be a mid-season miniboss on the road to the Dramatic Confrontation with Abby, that you've got to make it especially clear that he is capable of really nasty things. Sure, killing a truckful of guys is ALSO bad, but they were guys that we as viewers are all supposed to hate. Torturing a defenseless man reinforces the perception of him as someone that Ellie and Dina do <em>not</em> want to meet, especially now that they've popped a couple of his guys.</p>
<p>Because Ellie and Dina have unwittingly wandered into the middle of a Seattle civil war of sorts, between Isaac and his militarized WLF members and the face-cutting cultists we briefly met in the middle of last episode. And while the WLF types do seem to have the cult outgunned, we are told here that WLF members are slowly defecting to the cult (rather than the other way around).</p>

      Welcome back to "Jeffrey Wright discusses cookware." I'm Jeffrey Wright. Today on program, we have a very special guest...
        Credit:
          Warner Bros. Discovery
      
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I will say I appreciated the surprisingly cogent history of the "chicken and egg games" beef between the two factions, as discussed between torturer and torture victim. Definitely a memorable bit of world-building.</p>
<p>But then we're quickly back to the kind of infected attack scene that now seems practically contractually obligated to happen at least once an episode. At this point, I think these kinds of massive setpiece zombie battles would work better as a light seasoning than a thick sauce that just gets dumped on us almost every week.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: People in and from Seattle seem to have a unique gift for kicking up otherwise dormant swarms of infected! I know we'll get back to it eventually, but I was more intrigued by the first episode's reveal of more strategic infected that seemed to be retaining more of their human traits than I am by these screaming mindless hordes. Here, I think the tension is also ratcheted up artificially by Ellie's weird escape strategy, which is to lead the two of them through a series of dead ends and cul-de-sacs before finally, barely, getting away.</p>
<p>But like you said, gotta have zombies on the zombie show! And it does finally make the "Dina finds out that Ellie is immune" shoe drop, though Dina doesn't seem ready to think through any of the other implications of that reveal just yet. She has her own stuff going on!</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yes, I've had to resist my inclination to do the remote equivalent of nudging you in the ribs to see if you had picked up on the potential "morning sickness" explanation of Dina's frequent vomiting (which was hidden decently amid the "vomiting because of seeing horrifying gore" explanation).</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It does explain a couple of things! It does seem like a bit of a narrative shortcut to make Ellie extremely invested in Dina and whether she lives or dies, and given this show I am worried that this zygote is only going to be used to create more trauma for Ellie, rather than giving us a nuanced look at parenting during an apocalypse. But it is sweet to see how enthusiastically and immediately Ellie gets invested.</p>
<p>A question for you, while spoiling as little as you can: Are we still mostly just adapting the game at this point? You'd mentioned getting more Isaac backstory (sometimes the show expands on backstories well and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-episode-8-ruins-one-of-the-games-best-villains/">sometimes it doesn't</a>), and some things have happened a bit out of order. But my impression is that we haven't gotten a full departure a la the Nick Offerman episode from last season yet.</p>

      How do we keep getting into these messes?

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: At this point it's kind of like a jazz riff on what happens in the game, with some bits copied note for note, some remixed and thrown into entirely different temporal locations, and some fresh new improv thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>I'm definitely not a "the game is canon and you must interpret it literally" type of person, but the loose treatment is giving me a bit of whiplash. The reveal of Dina's pregnancy, for instance, is not greeted with nearly as much immediate joy in the games. That said, the moment of joy Ellie and Dina <em>do</em> share here feels transplanted (in tone if nothing else) from an earlier game scene that the show had mostly skipped thus far. It's like free association, man. Dig it!</p>
<p>The show also spends an inordinate amount of time discussing how pregnancy tests work in the post-apocalypse, which for me pushed past world-building and into overexplaining. It's OK to just let stuff be sometimes, y'know?</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It's jazz, man. It's about the zombies you <em>don't</em> kill.</p>
<p>However it's been rearranged, I can still tell I'm watching a video game adaptation, because there are stealth kills and because important information is conveyed via messages and logos scrawled in blood on the walls. But I am still enjoying myself, and doing <em>slightly</em> less minute-to-minute missing of Joel than I did last episode. Slightly.</p>
<p>The episode ends with Ellie and Dina hearing the name of someone who has the same name as someone who knew Abby over a WLF walkie-talkie they nabbed, which gives them their next objective marker for Abby Quest. But they've got to cross an active war zone to get where they're going (though I couldn't tell from that distance whether we're meant to be able to tell exactly who is fighting who at the moment). Guess I'll have to wait and see!</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personally, I'm hoping we see the moment where the newly out-and-proud bisexual Dina finally realizes "what's the deal with all the rainbows." Show your post-apocalyptic pride, girl!</div>

              <![CDATA[<p>It looks like Marvel has another critical and box office hit on its hands—and deservedly so—with <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolts*">Thunderbolts*</a>,</em> a follow-up of sorts to 2021's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/black-widow-review-scarjos-sendoff-is-mcus-best-standalone-film-yet/"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and the final film in the MCU's Phase Five.</p>
<p>Yes, the asterisk is part of the title. Yes, I found that choice inexplicable when it was first announced.  And yes, having seen the film, the asterisk makes perfect sense now as a well-timed joke. I won't spill the beans because that would spoil the fun. Instead, I'll simply say that <em>Thunderbolts*</em>  is a refreshing return to peak Marvel form: well-paced, witty, and action-packed with enough heart to ensure you care about the characters.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For many, many years, I wouldn't get a new game console until a couple years after it launched. This was partly because I wanted any new console I bought to have a decent-sized library of things to play, and partly because it sometimes paid to sit back and see which console was going to "win" the generation in terms of first-party exclusives and third-party developer support.</p>
<p>But mostly it was because, from the Atari VCS in the 70s all the way up through the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation in the 2010s, you could always count on game consoles getting cheaper as time went on. Those price reductions would often also come with internal tweaks and external redesigns—smaller or slimmer or otherwise improved versions of the console that made them superior to the originals (though you would occasionally lose a lesser-used feature or two along the way).</p>
<p>But both of those things have mostly stopped. The last permanent price drop for a major home or portable console we could find came back in 2016, when the PS4 Slim launched and dropped the price of entry from $349 to $299 (this doesn't count the launch of new editions of consoles with reduced feature sets, like the New Nintendo 2DS in 2017 or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-month-later-249-all-digital-xbox-one-s-still-seems-unsustainable/">$249 all-digital Xbox One</a> in 2019). This generation, we've seen something that would have been unheard of a few years ago: price <em>increases </em>for consoles, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">$50 extra for the new OLED edition</a> of the Nintendo Switch in 2021, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/ps5-slim-teardowns-suggest-same-chip-not-much-shrinking-but-nifty-disc-drive/">$50 price hike</a> for the slimmer disc-drive-less version of the PlayStation 5 in 2023, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">$80 to $100 price hikes</a> for the exact same unimproved versions of the Xbox Series S and X earlier this week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A young entrepreneur who was among the earliest known recruiters for Elon Musk’s so-called <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-mystery-general-services-administration/">Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</a> has a new, related gig—and he’s hiring. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/">Anthony Jancso</a>, cofounder of AcclerateX, a government tech startup, is looking for technologists to work on a project that aims to have artificial intelligence perform tasks that are currently the responsibility of tens of thousands of federal workers.</p>
<p>Jancso, a former Palantir employee, wrote in a Slack with about 2000 Palantir alumni in it that he’s hiring for a “DOGE orthogonal project to design benchmarks and deploy AI agents across live workflows in federal agencies,” according to an April 21 post reviewed by WIRED. Agents are programs that can perform work autonomously.</p>
<p>We’ve identified over 300 roles with almost full-process standardization, freeing up at least 70k FTEs for higher-impact work over the next year,” he continued, essentially claiming that tens of thousands of federal employees could see many aspects of their job automated and replaced by these AI agents. Workers for the project, he wrote, would be based on site in Washington, DC, and would not require a security clearance; it isn’t clear for whom they would work. Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/a-doge-recruiter-is-staffing-a-project-to-deploy-ai-agents-across-the-us-government/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The first production satellites for Amazon's Kuiper broadband network launched earlier this week, but if you tuned in to the mission's official livestream, the truncated coverage had the feel of a spy satellite launch.</p>
<p>This changed with a video Amazon posted on social media Friday, giving space enthusiasts and prospective Kuiper customers their first look at the real satellites. The 40-second clip shows the Kuiper satellites separating from their launch vehicle in the blackness of space following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/a-rocket-launch-monday-night-may-finally-jumpstart-amazons-answer-to-starlink/">liftoff Monday</a> from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.</p>
<p>Since Amazon unveiled Project Kuiper in 2019, officials at the retail giant have been shy about showing even the most basic imagery of their satellites. Images released by Amazon previously provided glimpses inside the company's satellite factory near Seattle, along with views of the shipping containers Amazon uses to transport spacecraft from Washington their launch base in Florida.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/we-finally-know-a-little-more-about-amazons-super-secret-satellites/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[The advertising remedy trial will begin on September 22.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>We sometimes think of Google as a search company, but that's merely incidental—Google is really the world's biggest advertiser. That's why the antitrust case focused on Google's ad tech business could have even more lasting effects than cases focused on search or mobile apps. The court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/google-loses-ad-tech-monopoly-trial-faces-additional-breakups/">ruled against Google last month</a>, and now both sides are lining up to present their proposed remedies in a trial later this year.</p>
<p>In today's hearing, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema set the beginning of that trial for September 22 of this year. Just like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">the search case</a>, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is aiming to hack off pieces of Google to level the playing field. Specifically, the DOJ is asking the court to force Google to sell two parts of the ad business: the ad exchange and the publisher ad server. The ad exchange is the world's largest marketplace for bidding on advertising space. The ad server, meanwhile, is a tool that publishers use to list and sell ads on their sites.</p>
<p>While Google lost the liability phase of the case, it won on the subject of ad networks. The court decided that the government had not proven that Google's acquisition of ad networks like DoubleClick and Admeld had harmed competition. So, Google won't have to worry about losing those parts of the business.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/doj-confirms-it-wants-to-break-up-googles-ad-business/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the last two weeks, in response to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/">Executive Order 14035</a>, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has discontinued funding for research on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as well as support for researchers from marginalized backgrounds. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">Executive Order 14168</a> ordered the NSF (and other federal agencies) to discontinue any research that focused on women, women in STEM, gender variation, and transsexual or transgender populations—and, oddly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2025/03/07/this-is-whats-behind-the-uproar-over-transgenic-mice/">transgenic mice</a>.</p>
<p>Then, another round of cancellations targeted research on misinformation and disinformation, a subject (among others) that Republican Senator Ted Cruz views as <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2024/10/new-cruz-investigation-reveals-how-biden-harris-diverted-billions-from-scientific-research-to-dei-activists">advancing neo-Marxist perspectives and class warfare</a>.</p>
<p>During the previous three years, I served as a program officer at the NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sosdci-science-science-discovery-communication-impact">Science of Science</a> (SOS) program. We reviewed, recommended, and awarded competitive research grants on science communication, including research on science communication to the public, communication of public priorities to scientists, and citizen engagement and participation in science. Projects my team reviewed and funded on misinformation are among the many others at NSF that have now been canceled (see the growing list <a href="https://airtable.com/appGKlSVeXniQZkFC/shrFxbl1YTqb3AyOO?jntvk%3Asort=eyJwZWw4ZlRSME8ycmFObWNUYyI6eyJjb2x1bW5JZCI6ImZsZHBpSTZqZUVYRWx3Und1IiwiYXNjZW5kaW5nIjp0cnVlfX0&amp;detail=eyJwYWdlSWQiOiJwYWduMzBQcXBvSzBCcHE2SCIsInJvd0lkIjoicmVjWnUwU3hLOVNRN25lcEYiLCJzaG93Q29tbWVudHMiOmZhbHNlLCJxdWVyeU9yaWdpbkhpbnQiOnsidHlwZSI6InBhZ2VFbGVtZW50IiwiZWxlbWVudElkIjoicGVsOGZUUjBPMnJhTm1jVGMiLCJxdWVyeUNvbnRhaW5lcklkIjoicGVsa25QS3haQU95am50dmsifX0">here</a>).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/editorial-censoring-the-scientific-enterprise-one-grant-at-a-time/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A judge who may be the first to rule on whether AI training data is fair use appeared skeptical Thursday at a hearing where Meta faced off with book authors over the social media company's alleged copyright infringement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meta, like most AI companies, holds that training must be deemed fair use, or else the entire AI industry could face immense setbacks, wasting precious time negotiating data contracts while falling behind global rivals. Meta urged the court to rule that AI training is a transformative use that only references books to create an entirely new work that doesn't replicate authors' ideas or replace books in their markets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the hearing that followed after both sides requested summary judgment, however, Judge Vince Chhabria pushed back on Meta attorneys arguing that the company's Llama AI models posed no threat to authors in their markets, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/judge-meta-case-weighs-key-question-ai-copyright-lawsuits-2025-05-01/">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/judge-on-metas-ai-training-i-just-dont-understand-how-that-can-be-fair-use/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is investigating two leading toothpaste makers over their use of fluoride, suggesting that they are "illegally marketing" the teeth cleaners to parents and kids "in ways that are misleading, deceptive, and dangerous."</p>
<p>The toothpaste makers in the crosshairs are Colgate-Palmolive Company, maker of Colgate toothpastes, and Proctor &amp; Gamble Manufacturing Co., which makes Crest toothpastes. In <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-launches-investigations-companies-illegally-marketing-toothpaste">an announcement Thursday</a>, Paxton said he has sent Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the companies.</p>
<p>The move is an escalation in an ongoing battle over fluoride, which effectively prevents dental cavities and improves oral health. Community water fluoridation has been hailed by health and dental experts as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html">one of the top 10 great public health interventions</a> for advancing oral health across communities, regardless of age, education, or income. But, despite the success, fluoride has always had detractors—from conspiracy theorists in the past suggesting the naturally occurring mineral is a form of communist mind control, to more recent times, in which low-quality, controversial studies have suggested that high doses may lower IQ in children.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/texas-goes-after-toothpaste-in-escalating-fight-over-fluoride/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the US Office of Management and Budget sent Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate's Appropriations Committee, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">an outline</a> of what to expect from the Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal. As expected, the budget includes widespread cuts, affecting nearly every branch of the federal government.</p>
<p>In keeping with the administration's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/nsf-director-resigns-amid-55-budget-cut-mass-layoffs-from-trump-admin/">attacks on research agencies</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-administrations-attack-on-university-research-accelerates/">places research gets done</a>, research funding will be taking an enormous hit, with the National Institutes of Health taking a 40 percent cut and the National Science Foundation losing 55 percent of its 2025 budget. But the budget goes well beyond those highlighted items, with nearly every place science gets done or funded targeted for cuts.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more shocking is the language used to justify the cuts, which reads more like a partisan rant than a serious budget document.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trumps-2026-budget-proposal-crippling-cuts-for-science-across-the-board/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Chevrolet provided flights from Washington, DC, to Charlotte and accommodation so Ars could drive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-chevrolet-blazer-ev-ss-first-drive-a-big-ride-and-handling-upgrade/">the Blazer EV SS</a>. I also took the opportunity to interview Ken Morris. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>CONCORD, N.C.—We weren't allowed cameras past the lobby of General Motors' shiny new Charlotte Technical Center. It's the automaker's new motorsport hub in the heart of NASCAR country, but the 130,000-square-foot (12,000 m2) facility is for much more than just stock cars. There are cutting-edge driver-in-the-loop simulators, shaker rigs for punishing suspension, and even an entire gym for drivers to work on their fitness.</p>
<p>It's also home to GM's racing command centers—conference rooms with walls of monitors where engineers and strategists provide remote support for GM's teams at their respective racetracks. It's pretty busy most weekends; this Saturday and Sunday, Chevrolet is racing in both IndyCar (in Alabama) and NASCAR (in Texas), next week, it's Chevrolet and Cadillac in Belgium for the World Endurance Championship and Northern California for IMSA, plus NASCAR in Kansas. Starting next year, F1's 24 races a year will be added to the mix as well.</p>
<p>The technical center had been sanitized before our group of journalists arrived, perhaps rendering the camera ban moot anyway. The smells, on the other hand, were intriguing—solvents, 3D printers, some other rapid prototyping, or maybe all of it all at once. If only websites were scratch and sniff.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/ai-strategists-formula-1-even-an-electric-nascar-we-talk-racing-with-gm/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We're on the verge of being screwwormed.</p>
<p>The biological barrier was breached, they're slithering toward our border, and the US Department of Agriculture is now carpet-bombing parts of Mexico with weaponized flies to stave off an invasion.</p>
<p>This is not a drill. Screwworms are possibly the most aptly named parasites imaginable, both literally and figuratively. Screwworms—technically, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/myiasis/about-new-world-screwworm-myiasis/index.html">New World Screwworms</a>—are flies that lay eggs on the mucous membranes, orifices, and wounds of warm-blooded animals. Wounds are the most common sites, and even a prick as small as a tick bite can be an invitation for the savage insects.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/screwworms-are-coming-and-theyre-just-as-horrifying-as-they-sound/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[New feature searches hundreds of sources to build a document—but is it accurate?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/integrations">announced</a> significant upgrades to its AI assistant Claude, extending its research capabilities to run for up to 45 minutes before delivering comprehensive reports. The company also expanded its integration options, allowing Claude to connect with popular third-party services.</p>
<p>Much like Google's Deep <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">Research</a> (which debuted on December 11) and ChatGPT's <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">deep research</a> features (February 2), Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/research">announced</a> its own "Research" feature on April 15. Each can autonomously browse the web and other online sources to compile research reports in document format, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/after-24-hour-hackathon-hugging-faces-ai-research-agent-nearly-matches-openais-solution/">open source clones</a> of the technique have debuted as well.</p>
<p>Now, Anthropic is taking its Research feature a step further. The upgraded mode enables Claude to conduct "deeper" investigations across "hundreds of internal and external sources," Anthropic says. When users toggle the Research button, Claude breaks down complex requests into smaller components, examines each one, and compiles a report with citations linking to original sources.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/claudes-ai-research-mode-now-runs-for-up-to-45-minutes-before-delivering-reports/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[NotebookLM is a genuinely useful AI tool, and it's coming to your phone. ]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>After several years of escalating AI hysteria, we are all familiar with Google's desire to put Gemini in every one of its products. That can be annoying, but NotebookLM is not—this one actually works. NotebookLM, which helps you parse documents, videos, and more using Google's advanced AI models, has been available on the web <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-new-notebooklm-app-builds-a-custom-ai-based-on-a-source-document/">since 2023</a>, but Google recently confirmed it would finally get an Android app. You can get a look at the app now, but it's not yet available to install.</p>
<p>Until now, NotebookLM was only a website. You can visit it on your phone, but the interface is clunky compared to the desktop version. The arrival of the mobile app will change that. Google said it plans to release the app at Google I/O in late May, but the listing is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.labs.language.tailwind">live in the Play Store early</a>. You can pre-register to be notified when the download is live, but you'll have to tide yourself over with the screenshots for the time being.</p>
<p>NotebookLM relies on the same underlying technology as Google's other chatbots and AI projects, but instead of a general purpose robot, NotebookLM is only concerned with the documents you upload. It can assimilate text files, websites, and videos, including multiple files and source types for a single agent. It has a hefty context window of 500,000 tokens and supports document uploads as large as 200MB. Google says this creates a queryable "AI expert" that can answer detailed questions and brainstorm ideas based on the source data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-finally-reveals-notebooklm-android-app-but-you-cant-use-it-yet/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The distinctive chirps of singing cicadas are a highlight of summer in regions where they proliferate; those chirps even featured prominently on Lorde's 2021 album <em>Solar Power</em>. Now, Japanese scientists at the University of Tsukuba have figured out how to transform cicadas into cyborg insects capable of "playing" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachelbel's_Canon">Pachelbel's Canon</a>. They described their work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16459">a preprint</a> published on the physics arXiv. You can listen to the sounds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p49K0L2fSig">here</a>.</p>
<p>Scientists have been intrigued by the potential of cyborg insects since the 1990s, when researchers began implanting tiny electrodes into cockroach antennae and shocking them to direct their movements. The idea was to use them as hybrid robots for search-and-rescue applications.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2015, Texas A&amp;M scientists <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2014.1363">found that</a> implanting electrodes into a cockroach's ganglion (the neuron cluster that controls its front legs) was remarkably effective at successfully steering the roaches 60 percent of the time. They outfitted the roaches with tiny backpacks synced with a remote controller and administered shocks to disrupt the insect's balance, forcing it to move in the desired direction</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/cyborg-cicadas-play-pachelbels-canon/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump escalated his attack on NPR and PBS on Thursday when he signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ending-taxpayer-subsidization-of-biased-media/">executive order</a> demanding the end of all federal funding supporting the news outlets.</p>
<p>In his order, Trump claimed that unlike in the 1960s, when the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was funded to ensure Americans had access to critical news, there are plenty of news options today. He has joined other Republicans accusing NPR and PBS of promoting a left-leaning bias. In a White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/president-trump-finally-ends-the-madness-of-npr-pbs/">statement</a>, he ordered any agency directly or indirectly funding the outlets' allegedly "woke propaganda" to "end the madness" as soon as possible, cutting off current funding "to the maximum extent allowed by law" and declining "to provide future funding."</p>
<p>Trump's authority to cut off CPB's funding continues to be disputed. In March, his administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/white-house-aims-to-defund-npr-and-pbs-in-move-slammed-as-cultural-sabotage/">reportedly</a> planned to direct Congress to rescind CPB funding—as both NPR and PBS are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/02/nx-s1-5384790/trump-orders-end-to-federal-funding-for-npr-and-pbs">fully funded through 2027</a>—but <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-signs-executive-order-directing-federal-funding-cuts-to-pbs-and-npr">according to PBS</a>, budget director Russell Vought has yet to send over any guidance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/blatantly-unlawful-trump-slammed-for-trying-to-defund-pbs-npr/">Read full article</a></p>
