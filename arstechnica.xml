<p>The arrival of four new astronauts as part of the Crew 12 mission—Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway of NASA, Sophie Adenot of the European Space Agency, and Andrey Fedyaev of Roscosmos—brought the total number of crew on board the space station to seven, giving the US space agency a full complement in orbit.</p>
<p>The number of astronauts living on board the station fluctuates over time, depending on crew rotations and private astronauts making shorter stays, but since Crew Dragon began flying regularly at the end of 2020 NASA has sought to keep at least four "USOS" astronauts on board at all time. This stands for "US Orbital Segment," and means astronauts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan who are trained to operate the areas of the station maintained by NASA and its partner astronauts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/space-station-returns-to-a-full-crew-complement-after-a-month/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A recent study showed that Mars was warm and wet billions of years ago. The finding contrasts with another theory that this era was mainly cold and icy. The result has implications for the idea that life could have developed on the planet at this time.</p>
<p>Whether Mars was once habitable is a fascinating and intensely researched topic of interest over many decades. <a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/mars-178">Mars</a>, like the Earth, is about 4.5 billion years old and its geological history is divided into different epochs of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02856-3">The latest paper</a> relates to Mars during a time called the Noachian epoch, which extended from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago. This was during a stage in solar system history called the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/lunar-craters/what-is-the-late-heavy-bombardment/">Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB)</a>. Evidence for truly cataclysmic meteorite impacts during the LHB are found on many bodies throughout the solar system.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/ancient-mars-was-warm-and-wet-not-cold-and-icy/">Read full article</a></p>

That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.</p>
<p>That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.</p>
<p>Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2026/02/editors-note-retraction-of-article-containing-fabricated-quotations/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>It was the image that launched a cultural icon. In 1967, in the Northern California woods, a 7-foot-tall, ape-like creature covered in black fur and walking upright was captured on camera, at one point turning around to look straight down the lens. The image is endlessly copied in popular culture—it’s even become an emoji. But what was it? A hoax? A bear? Or a real-life example of a mysterious species called the Bigfoot?</em></p>
<p><em>The film has been analysed and re-analysed <a href="https://www.discoveryuk.com/mysteries/the-patterson-gimlin-film-evidence-of-bigfoot-or-elaborate-hoax/">countless times</a>. Although most people believe it was some sort of hoax, there are some who argue that it’s never been definitively debunked. One group of people, dubbed Bigfooters, is so intrigued that they have taken to the forests of Washington, California, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, and beyond to look for evidence of the mythical creature.</em></p>
<p><em>But why? That’s what sociologists Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to uncover. They were itching to understand what prompts this community to spend valuable time and resources looking for a beast that is highly unlikely to even exist. During lockdown, Lewis started interviewing more than 130 Bigfooters (and a few academics) about their views, experiences, and practices, culminating in <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Bigfooters-and-Scientific-Inquiry-On-the-Borderlands-of-Legitimate-Science/Lewis-Bartlett/p/book/9781032777832">the duo’s recent book</a> "Bigfooters and Scientific Inquiry: On the Borderlands of Legitimate Science."</em></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/it-aint-no-unicorn-these-researchers-have-interviewed-130-bigfoot-hunters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Saturday the agency is looking at ways to prevent the fueling problems plaguing the Space Launch System rocket before the Artemis III mission.</p>
<p>Artemis III is slated to be the first crew mission to land on the Moon since the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. As for Artemis II, which remains on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after missing a launch window earlier this month, NASA is preparing for a second countdown rehearsal as soon as next week to confirm whether technicians have resolved a hydrogen fuel leak that cut short a practice countdown run February 2.</p>
<p>Artemis II is the first crew flight for SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The nearly 10-day mission will carry four astronauts around the far side of the Moon and return them to Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-chief-vows-to-solve-sls-rocket-fueling-issues-before-artemis-iii/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It's Valentine's Day, and while there are plenty of classic and current rom-coms out there for those wishing to immerse themselves in warm and fuzzy feelings, we're opting to celebrate in a different way: honoring Ang Lee's 2000 masterpiece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon"><em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em></a>, a <em>wuxia</em> tragic fairy tale featuring one of the most beautifully heartbreaking love stories in film at its center. It's also got stunning cinematography and tons of awe-inspiring martial arts sequences, which makes it my personal perfect date night movie.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below, but we will give you a heads up before the major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>The film is adapted from a 1940s novel by Wang Dulu and is set sometime during the Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 through 1912. (No specific date is given.) The title is a direct translation of a line from a 6th century Chinese poem: "behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon." It's generally interpreted as a description of legendary martial arts masters living un-noticed and/or hiding in plain sight—until someone picks a fight, that is. And some of those hidden masters are women.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/a-valentines-day-homage-to-crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Out beyond the orbit of Neptune lies an expansive ring of ancient relics, dynamical enigmas, and possibly a hidden planet—or two.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/kuiper-belt/">Kuiper Belt</a>, a region of frozen debris about 30 to 50 times farther from the sun than the Earth is—and perhaps farther, though nobody knows—has been shrouded in mystery since it first came into view in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, astronomers have cataloged about 4,000 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), including a smattering of dwarf worlds, icy comets, and leftover planet parts. But that number is expected to increase tenfold in the coming years as observations from more advanced telescopes pour in. In particular, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile will illuminate this murky region with its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which began operating last year. Other next-generation observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will also help to bring the belt into focus.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/astronomers-are-filling-in-the-blanks-of-the-kuiper-belt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization on Friday released a formal statement <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-02-2026-statement-on-the-planned-hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccine-trial-in-guinea-bissau">blasting a US-funded vaccine trial as "unethical,"</a> because it would withhold an established, safe, and potentially lifesaving vaccine against hepatitis B from some newborns in Guinea-Bissau, Africa.</p>
<p>"In its current form, and based on publicly available information, the trial is inconsistent with established ethical and scientific principles," the WHO concluded, after providing a bullet-point list of reasons the trial was harmful and low quality.</p>
<p>The trial has drawn widespread condemnation from health experts since <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/18/2025-23245/notice-of-award-of-a-single-source-unsolicited-grant-to-fund-university-of-southern-denmark-sdu">notice of the US funding</a> was published in the Federal Register in December. The notice revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—had awarded $1.6 million to Danish researchers for their non-competitive, unsolicited proposal to conduct the trial.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/who-slams-us-funded-newborn-vaccine-trial-as-unethical/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon this week imposed a new roadblock for people who want to pay off device installment plans early in order to get their phones unlocked. The latest version of Verizon's <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy">device unlocking policy</a> for postpaid customers imposes a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off their device installment plan online or in the Verizon app.</p>
<p>Payments made over the phone also trigger a 35-day waiting period, as do payments made at Verizon Authorized Retailers. Getting an immediate unlock apparently requires paying off the device plan at a Verizon corporate store.</p>
<p>Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on another network, letting customers switch from one carrier to another. Previously, the 35-day waiting period for unlocks was only applied when a customer paid off the plan with a Verizon gift card.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-makes-customers-wait-35-days-to-unlock-fully-paid-off-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The decision came after Amazon faced substantial backlash for airing a Super Bowl ad that was meant to be warm and fuzzy, but instead came across as disturbing and dystopian.</p>
<p>The ad begins with a young girl surprised to receive a puppy as a gift. It then warns that 10 million dogs go missing annually. Showing a series of lost dog posters, the ad introduces a new "Search Party" feature for Ring cameras that promises to revolutionize how neighbors come together to locate missing pets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/after-creepy-super-bowl-ad-sparks-outrage-ring-abandons-flock-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed some reporting a few days ago that Android 17 was rolling out in beta form, but that didn't happen. For reasons Google still has not explained, the release was canceled. Two days later, <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2026/02/the-first-beta-of-android-17.html">Android 17 is here for real</a>. If you've got a recent Pixel device, you can try the latest version today, but don't expect big changes just yet—there's still a long way to go before release.</p>
<p>Google will probably have more to say about feature changes for Android 17 in the coming months, but this first wide release is aimed mostly at testing system and API changes. One of the biggest changes in the beta is expanded support for adaptive apps, which ensures that apps can scale to different screen sizes. That makes apps more usable on large-screen devices like tablets and foldables with multiple displays.</p>
<p>We first saw this last year in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-review-post-hype/">Android 16</a>, but developers were permitted to opt out of support. The new adaptive app roadmap puts an end to that. Any app that targets Android 17 (API level 37) must support resizing and windowed multitasking. Apps can continue to target the older API for the time being, but Google filters apps from the Play Store if they don't keep up.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/the-first-android-17-beta-is-now-available-on-pixel-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Longtime fans of the cult TV show <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> know that the series’ one constant is change (well, that and bad movies).</p>
<p>The show’s cast and crew were in a near-constant state of flux, a byproduct of the show's existence as a perennial bubble show produced in the Twin Cities rather than a TV-and-comedy hub like New York or LA. It was rare, especially toward the middle of its 10-season original run on national TV, for the performers in front of the camera (and the writers’ room, since they were all the same people) to stay the same for more than a season or two.</p>
<p>Series creator Joel Hodgson embraced that spirit of change for the show's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/netflix-will-stream-14-episodes-of-mystery-science-theater-3000-revival/">Kickstarter-funded, Netflix-aired revival</a> in the mid-2010s, featuring a brand-new cast and mostly new writers. And that change only accelerated in the show's brief post-Netflix "Gizmoplex" era, which featured a revolving cast of performers that could change from episode to episode. Hodgson leaned into the idea that as long as there were silhouettes and puppets talking in front of a bad movie, it didn't matter much <em>who</em> was doing the talking.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/1-8-million-mst3k-kickstarter-brings-in-almost-everyone-from-the-old-show/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of unanswered questions about the origin of life on Earth. But the research community has largely reached consensus that one of the key steps was the emergence of an RNA molecule that could replicate itself. RNA, like its more famous relative DNA, can carry genetic information. But it can also fold up into three-dimensional structures that act as catalysts. These two features have led to the suggestion that early life was protein-free, with RNA handling both heredity and catalyzing a simple metabolism.</p>
<p>For this to work, one of the reactions that the early RNAs would need to catalyze is the copying of RNA molecules, without which any sort of heritability would be impossible. While we've found a number of catalytic RNAs that can copy other molecules, none have been able to perform a key reaction: making a copy of themselves. Now, however, a team has found an incredibly short piece of RNA—just 45 bases long—that can make a copy of itself.</p>
<h2>Finding an RNA polymerase</h2>
<p>We have identified a large number of catalytic RNAs (generically called ribozymes, for RNA-based enzymes), and some of them can catalyze reactions involving other RNAs. A handful of these are ligases, which link together two RNA molecules. In some cases, they need these molecules to be held together by a third RNA molecule that base pairs with both of them. We've only identified a few that can act as polymerases, which add RNA bases to a growing molecule, one at a time, with each new addition base pairing with a template molecule.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/researchers-find-small-rnas-that-can-make-copies-of-themselves/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Autonomous vehicles have a lot of potential. As long as you program them right, they won't speed, won't break traffic laws, and won't get drunk, high, abusive, or violent. And the technology has been getting much more capable, even as some of the hype has died down, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/seeing-no-road-to-profit-gm-shutters-cruise/">taking some</a> of the related companies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/self-driving-startups-are-becoming-an-endangered-species/">with it</a>. Waymo still easily leads the field and is already operating commercially in six cities across America, with a dozen more (plus London) coming soon. Waymos can even drop you off and pick you up at the airport in Phoenix and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Soon, Waymo will begin deploying its sixth-generation Waymo Driver, using upfitted Zeekr Ojai minivans, adding to the Jaguar I-Paces that have become so common on San Francisco streets and to its fleet of Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric vehicles. It has upgraded the cameras, lidar, and radar, meaning the cars can better sense their environments at night and in inclement weather. There are even microphones that can pick up sounds like sirens to better inform the robotaxi of the direction the emergency vehicle(s) are coming from.</p>
<p>But even with all these advances since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/05/googles-quirky-self-driving-bubble-car-hits-public-roads-this-summer/">pod-like two-seater</a> that predates even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/google-spins-out-self-driving-car-unit-now-called-waymo/">the Waymo name</a>, there are still a few things that remain beyond a robotaxi's capabilities. Like closing a door a passenger left open on their way out. All the sophisticated sensors and high-powered computer processing in the world are useless if the car can't move until the door closes and there's no one there to give it a hand.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/what-if-riders-dont-close-a-robotaxi-door-after-a-ride-try-doordash/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, does not often post on the social media site owned by his rival Elon Musk. But on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/2020861883524247807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bezos did</a>, sharing a black-and-white image of a turtle emerging from the shadows on X.</p>
<p>The photo, which included no text, may have stumped some observers. Yet for anyone familiar with Bezos' privately owned space company, Blue Origin, the message was clear. The company’s coat of arms prominently features two turtles, a reference to one of Aesop’s Fables, "The Tortoise and the Hare," in which the slow and steady tortoise wins the race over a quicker but overconfident hare.</p>
<p>Bezos' foray into social media turtle trolling came about 12 hours after Musk made major waves in the space community <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/has-elon-musk-given-up-on-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by announcing</a> that SpaceX was pivoting toward the Moon, rather than Mars, as a near-term destination. It represented a huge shift in Musk's thinking, as the SpaceX founder has long spoken of building a multi-planetary civilization on Mars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/why-is-bezos-trolling-musk-on-x-with-turtle-pics-because-he-has-a-new-moon-plan/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I’m not above doing some <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/gig-economy/">gig work</a> to make ends meet. In my life, I’ve worked snack food pop-ups in a grocery store, ran the cash register for random merch booths, and even hawked my own plasma at $35 per vial.</p>
<p>So, when I saw RentAHuman, a new site where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malevolent-ai-agent-openclaw-clawdbot/">AI agents</a> hire humans to perform physical work in the real world on behalf of the virtual bots, I was eager to see how these AI overlords would compare to my past experiences with the gig economy.</p>
<p>Launched in early February, <a href="https://rentahuman.ai/">RentAHuman</a> was developed by software engineer Alexander Liteplo and his cofounder, Patricia Tani. The site looks like a bare-bones version of other well-known freelance sites like Fiverr and UpWork.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/i-spent-two-days-gigging-at-rentahuman-and-didnt-make-a-single-cent/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.29 of the Rocket Report! We have a stuffed report this week with news from across the launch spectrum. Long-term, probably the most significant development this week was a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket successfully launching and then executing a picture-perfect ocean landing. China is catching up rapidly to the United States when it comes to reusable launch.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Orbex is going away</strong>. The UK-based launch company Orbex has entered insolvency proceedings after a planned takeover by European space logistics startup The Exploration Company fell through, <a href="https://europeanspaceflight.com/orbex-fails-after-planned-purchase-falls-through/">European Spaceflight reports</a>. In a statement, Orbex said the decision came after all "fundraising, merger and acquisition opportunities had all concluded unsuccessfully." For anyone paying attention, this decision should not come as a surprise. A decade into its existence, Orbex had yet to produce demonstrable, ready-for-flight hardware.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/rocket-report-say-cheerio-to-orbex-china-is-getting-good-at-booster-landings/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Alleging that ICE officers are being doxed or otherwise endangered, Trump officials have spent the last year targeting an unknown number of users and platforms with demands to censor content. Early lawsuits show that platforms have caved, even though experts say they could refuse these demands without a court order.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The heavy version of Europe's Ariane 6 rocket launched for the first time Thursday, hauling 32 spacecraft to low-Earth orbit for Amazon's satellite broadband constellation.</p>
<p>The Ariane 6 rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center on the northeastern coast of South America at 11:45 am EST (16:45 UTC), quickly soaring into a clear sky at the tropical spaceport on the power of a hydrogen-fueled main engine and four strap-on solid rocket boosters.</p>
<p>This Ariane 6 configuration, called Ariane 64, is the first to use the rocket's full complement of four boosters. Collectively, the rocket generated more than 3.4 million pounds of thrust (15,400 kilonewtons) of thrust as it steered northeast over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the rocket's upper stage released all 32 of Amazon's satellites into an on-target orbit at an altitude of 289 miles (465 kilometers).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/when-amazon-badly-needed-a-ride-europes-ariane-6-rocket-delivered/">Read full article</a></p>
