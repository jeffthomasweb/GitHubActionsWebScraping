<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, Apple announced it would be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-integrates-chatgpt-into-siri-ios-and-mac-os/">integrating</a> OpenAI's ChatGPT AI assistant into upcoming versions of its iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems. It paves the way for future third-party AI model integrations, but given Google's multi-billion-dollar <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/google-deal-may-have-kept-apple-from-building-search-engine-exec-says/">deal with Apple</a> for preferential web search, the OpenAI announcement inspired speculation about who is paying whom. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash">Bloomberg report</a> published Wednesday, Apple considers ChatGPT's placement on its devices as compensation enough.</p>

<p>"Apple isn’t paying OpenAI as part of the partnership," writes Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, citing people familiar with the matter who wish to remain anonymous. "Instead, Apple believes pushing OpenAI’s brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments."</p>
<p>The Bloomberg report states that neither company expects the agreement to generate meaningful revenue in the short term, and in fact, the partnership could burn extra money for OpenAI, because it pays Microsoft to host ChatGPT's capabilities on its Azure cloud. However, OpenAI could benefit by converting free users to paid subscriptions, and Apple potentially benefits by providing easy, built-in access to ChatGPT during a time when its own in-house LLMs are still catching up.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031318#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031318&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gamers of a certain age may remember Nintendo's Game &amp; Watch line, which predated the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/game-boy-20th-anniversary/">cartridge-based Game Boy</a> by offering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/play-tamagotchi-mc-hammer-and-more-lcd-handheld-wonders-in-your-browser/">simple, single-serving LCD games</a> that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/rare-nintendo-game-watch-unit-fetches-9000-at-auction/">fetch a pretty penny at auction today</a>. But even most ancient gamers probably don't remember Mego's "Time Out" line, which took the internal of Nintendo's early Game &amp; Watch titles and rebranded them for an American audience that hadn't yet heard of the Japanese game maker.</p>
<p>Now, the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has helped preserve <a href="https://gamehistory.org/mego-time-out-commercial/">the original film of an early Mego Time Out commercial</a>, marking the recovered, digitized video as "what we believe is the first commercial for a Nintendo product in the United States." The 30-second TV spot—which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xVT5i1muxE">now available in a high-quality digital transfer</a> for the first time—provides a fascinating glimpse into how marketers positioned some of Nintendo's earliest games to a public that still needed to be sold on the very idea of portable gaming.</p>

In 1980, though, Mego branched out to partner with a brand-new, pre-<em>Donkey Kong</em> Nintendo of America to release rebranded versions of four early Game &amp; Watch titles: <em>Ball</em> (which became Mego's "Toss-Up"), <em>Vermin</em> ("Exterminator"), <em>Fire</em> ("Fireman Fireman"), and <em>Flagman</em> ("Flag Man").</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031362#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031362&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An Indiana cop has resigned after it was revealed that he frequently used Clearview AI facial recognition technology to track down social media users not linked to any crimes.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://city-countyobserver.com/443846-2/">press release</a> from the Evansville Police Department, this was a clear "misuse" of Clearview AI's controversial face scan tech, which some US cities have banned over concerns that it gives law enforcement unlimited power to track people in their daily lives.</p>
<p>To help identify suspects, police can scan what Clearview AI describes on its website as "the world's largest facial recognition network." The database pools more than 40 billion images collected from news media, mugshot websites, public social media, and other open sources.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031338#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031338&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a case that<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/a-deep-dive-into-the-scotus-abortion-pill-case-and-whats-at-stake-for-the-fda/"> threatened to remove or at least restrict access to mifepristone</a>, a pill approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medication abortions and used in miscarriage care. The drug has been used for decades, racking up a remarkably good safety record in that time. It is currently used in the majority of abortions in the US.</p>
<p>The high court found that the anti-abortion medical groups that legally challenged the FDA's decision to approve the drug in 2000 and then ease usage restrictions in 2016 and 2021 simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/abortion-pill-case-scotus-skeptical-of-anti-abortion-groups-legal-standing/">lacked standing</a> to challenge any of those decisions. That is, the groups failed to demonstrate that they were harmed by the FDA's decision and therefore had no grounds to legally challenge the government agency's actions. The ruling tracks closely with comments and questions the justices raised during oral arguments in March.</p>
<p>"Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used <em>by others</em>," the Supreme Court noted in its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-235_n7ip.pdf">opinion</a>, which included the emphasis on "by others." The court summarized that the groups offered "complicated causation theories to connect FDA’s actions to the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries in fact," and the court found that "none of these theories suffices" to prove harm.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031323#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031323&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk said last night that Tesla shareholders provided enough votes to re-approve his 2018 pay package, which was previously nullified by a Delaware judge. A proposal to transfer Tesla's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas also has enough votes to pass, according to a post by Musk.</p>
<p>"Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!" <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1801084780035154058">Musk wrote</a>. His post included charts indicating that both shareholder resolutions had more than enough yes votes to surpass the "guaranteed win" threshold.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/musk-says-vote-on-his-pay-winning-by-wide-margins-647c2355">notes</a> that the "results provided by Musk are preliminary, and voters can change their votes until the polls close at the meeting on Thursday." The <a href="https://www.tesla.com/2024shareholdermeeting">shareholder meeting</a> is at 3:30 pm Central Time.

<p>Victor Miller is running for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, with an unusual campaign promise: If elected, he will <i>not be</i> calling the shots—an AI bot will. VIC, the Virtual Integrated Citizen, is a ChatGPT-based chatbot that Miller created. And Miller says the bot has better ideas—and a better grasp of the law—than many people currently serving in government.</p>
<p>“I realized that this entity is way smarter than me, and more importantly, way better than some of the outward-facing public servants I see,” he says. According to Miller, VIC will make the decisions, and Miller will be its “meat puppet,” attending meetings, signing documents, and otherwise doing the corporeal job of running the city.</p>
<p>But whether VIC—and Victor—will be allowed to run at all is still an open question.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031255#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031255&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="bolded">hen Ina Chung,</span> a Colorado mother, first fed packaged foods to her infant, she was careful to read the labels. Her daughter was allergic to peanuts, dairy, and eggs, so products containing those ingredients were out. So were foods with labels that said they <em>may contain</em> the allergens.</p>
<p>Chung felt like this last category suggested a clear risk that wasn’t worth taking. “I had heard that the ingredient labels were regulated. And so I thought that that included those statements,” said Chung. “Which was not true.”</p>
<p>Precautionary allergen labels like those that say "processed in a facility that uses milk" or "may contain fish" are meant to address the potential for cross-contact. For instance, a granola bar that doesn’t list peanuts as an ingredient could still say they <em>may</em> be included. And in the United States, these warnings are not regulated; companies can use whatever precautionary phrasing they choose on any product. Some don’t bother with any labels, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jaoac/article/101/1/23/5653903">even in facilities</a> where unintended allergens slip in; others list allergens that may pose little risk. Robert Earl, vice president of regulatory affairs at Food Allergy Research &amp; Education, or <a href="https://www.foodallergy.org/">FARE</a>, a nonprofit advocacy, research, and education group, has even seen such labels that include all nine common food allergens. “I would bet my bottom dollar not all of those allergens are even in the facility,” he said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031214#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031214&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Roku TV owners have been introduced to a number of annoyances recently through the software update pipeline. There was an arbitration-demanding terms of service that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/disgraceful-messy-tos-update-allegedly-locks-roku-devices-until-users-give-in/">locked your TV until you agreed</a> (or mailed a letter). There is the upcoming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/roku-ad-push-continues-with-plans-to-put-video-ads-in-os-home-screen/">introduction of ads to the home screen</a>. But the latest irritation hits some Roku owners right in the eyes.</p>
<p>Reports on <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Discussions/Motion-Smoothing-out-of-nowhere/m-p/974654">Roku's community forums</a> and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1ddywvp/tcl_has_action_smoothing_out_of_the_blue/">Reddit</a> find owners of TCL HDTVs, on which Roku is a built-in OS, experiencing "motion smoothing" without having turned it on after updating to Roku OS 13. Some people are reporting that their TV never offered "Action Smoothing" before, but it is now displaying the results with no way to turn it off. Neither the TV's general settings, nor the specific settings available while content is playing, offer a way to turn it off, according to some users.</p>
<p>"Action smoothing" is Roku's name for video interpolation, or motion smoothing. The heart of motion smoothing is Motion Estimation Motion Compensation (MEMC). Fast-moving video, such as live sports or intense action scenes, can have a "juddery" feeling when shown on TVs at a lower frame rate. Motion smoothing uses MEMC hardware and algorithms to artificially boost the frame rate of a video signal by creating its best guess of what a frame between two existing frames would look like and then inserting it to boost the frame rate.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031173#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031173&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Saturday, Turkish police arrested and detained a prospective university student who is accused of developing an elaborate scheme to use AI and hidden devices to help him cheat on an important entrance exam, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/turkish-student-arrested-using-ai-cheat-university-exam-2024-06-11/">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13519405/Turkish-student-used-AI-software-cheat-university-exam-disguising-camera-shirt-button-hiding-router-shoe-jailed.html">The Daily Mail</a>.</p>
<p>The unnamed student is reportedly jailed pending trial after the incident, which took place in the southwestern province of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isparta">Isparta</a>, where the student was caught behaving suspiciously during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Selection_and_Placement_System">TYT</a>. The TYT is a nationally held university aptitude exam that determines a person's eligibility to attend a university in Turkey—and cheating on the high-stakes exam is a serious offense.</p>
<p>According to police reports, the student used a camera disguised as a shirt button, connected to AI software via a "router" (possibly a mistranslation of a cellular modem) hidden in the sole of their shoe. The system worked by scanning the exam questions using the button camera, which then relayed the information to an unnamed AI model. The software generated the correct answers and recited them to the student through an earpiece.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031012#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031012&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>You can now buy a Starlink satellite dish for $299 (plus shipping and tax) in 28 US states due to a discount for areas where SpaceX's broadband network has excess capacity.</p>
<p>Starlink had raised its upfront hardware cost from $499 to $599 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/starlink-hikes-prices-to-599-up-front-and-110-per-month-blames-inflation/">in March 2022</a> but cut the <a href="https://www.starlink.com/service-plans">standard price</a> back down to $499 this week. In the 28 states where the network has what SpaceX deems excess capacity, a $200 discount is being applied to bring the price down to $299. It's unclear how long the deal will last, though we can assume the number of states eligible for $299 pricing will fall if a lot of people sign up.</p>
<p>"In the United States, new orders in certain regions are eligible for a one-time savings in areas where Starlink has abundant network availability," a <a href="https://support.starlink.com/?topic=efa87a10-aa1d-783a-ae80-0e1425041708">support page</a> posted yesterday said. "$200 will be removed from your Starlink kit price when ordering on Starlink.com and if activated after purchasing from a retailer, a $200 credit will be applied. The savings are only available for Residential Standard service in these designated regional savings areas."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031158#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031158&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Wednesday, Stability AI released weights for <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-medium">Stable Diffusion 3 Medium</a>, an AI image-synthesis model that turns text prompts into AI-generated images. Its arrival has been ridiculed online, however, because it generates images of humans in a way that seems like a step backward from other state-of-the-art image-synthesis models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/a-crazy-update-midjourney-v6-upgrade-heaps-on-ai-generated-detail/">Midjourney</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">DALL-E 3</a>. As a result, it can churn out wild anatomically incorrect visual abominations with ease.</p>

<p>A thread on Reddit, titled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1de7lbg/is_this_release_supposed_to_be_a_joke_sd32b/">Is this release supposed to be a joke? [SD3-2B],</a>" details the spectacular failures of SD3 Medium at rendering humans, especially human limbs like hands and feet. Another thread, titled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1de85nc/why_is_sd3_so_bad_at_generating_girls_lying_on/">Why is SD3 so bad at generating girls lying on the grass?</a>" shows similar issues, but for entire human bodies.</p>
<p>Hands have traditionally been a challenge for AI image generators due to lack of good examples in early training data sets, but more recently, several image-synthesis models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ai-imager-midjourney-v5-stuns-with-photorealistic-images-and-5-fingered-hands/">seemed to have overcome the issue</a>. In that sense, SD3 appears to be a huge step backward for the image-synthesis enthusiasts that gather on Reddit—especially compared to recent Stability releases like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/stable-diffusion-turbo-xl-accelerates-image-synthesis-with-one-step-generation/">SD XL Turbo</a> in November.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031050#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031050&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-reshapes-fitbit-in-its-image-as-users-allege-planned-obsolescence/">continued abuse</a> of the Fitbit brand is continuing with the shutdown of the web dashboard. Fitbit.com used to be both a storefront and a way for users to get a big-screen UI to sift through reams of fitness data. The store <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/27/fitbit-google-store-replaced/">closed up shop</a> in April, and now the web dashboard <a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-com-Dashboard/Fitbit-com-web-dashboard-is-transitioning-to-the-Fitbit-app/td-p/5613159">is dying</a> in July.</p>
<p>In a post on the "Fitbit Community" forums, the company said: "Next month, we’re consolidating the Fitbit.com dashboard into the Fitbit app. The web browser will no longer offer access to the Fitbit.com dashboard after July 8, 2024." That's it. There's no replacement or new fitness thing Google is more interested in; web functionality is just being removed. Google, we'll remind you, used to be a web company. Now it's a phone app or nothing. Google did the same thing to its Google Fit product <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-fit-website-to-close-on-march-19-shifting-focus-to-mobile-and-smartwatch/">in 2019</a>, killing off the more powerful website in favor of an app focus.</p>
<p>Dumping the web app leaves a few holes in Fitbit's ecosystem. The Fitbit app doesn't support big screens like tablet devices, so this is removing the only large-format interface for data. Fitbit's competitors all have big-screen interfaces. Garmin has a <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/">very similar</a> website, and the Apple Watch has <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/get-started-with-health-ipadf82bbc87/ipados">an iPad health app</a>. This isn't an improvement. To make matters worse, the app does not have the features of the web dashboard, with many of the <em>livid</em> comments in the forums <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/1ddm7yp/fitbitcom_web_dashboard_shutting_down_in_july/">on Reddit</a> calling out the app's deficiencies in graphing, achievement statistics, calorie counting, and logs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030992#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030992&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>I'm still in the very early stages of poking at macOS 15 Sequoia ahead of our customary review later this fall, and there are quite a few things that aren't working in this first developer beta. Some of those, like the AI features, aren't working on purpose; I am sure some of the iCloud sync issues I'm having are broken by accident.</p>

<p>I've already encountered a few functional upgrades I like, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-quietly-improves-mac-virtualization-in-macos-15-sequoia/">iCloud support inside of virtual machines</a>, automated window snapping (at long last), and a redesigned AirDrop interface in the Finder. But so far the change that I like the most is actually a new combo wallpaper and screen saver that's done in the style of Apple's Mac operating system circa the original monochrome Mac from 1984.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Inhabitants of the ancient Maya city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza">Chichén Itzá</a> are well-known for their practice of ritual human sacrifice. The most prevalent notion in the popular imagination is that of young Maya women being flung alive into sink holes as offerings to the gods. Details about the cultural context for these sacrifices remain fuzzy, so scientists conduced genetic analysis on ancient remains of some of the sacrificial victims to learn more. That analysis confirmed the prevalence of male sacrifices, according to a <a href="https://www.mpg.de/22037367/0606-evan-ancient-maya-genomes-150495-x">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature, often of related children (ages 6 to 12) from the same household—including two pairs of identical twins.</p>
<p>Chichén Itzá ("at the mouth of the well of the Itzá") is located in Mexico's eastern Yucatán. It was one of the largest of the Maya cities, quite possibly one of the mythical capital cities (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dll%C4%81n">Tollans</a></em>) that are frequently mentioned in Mesoamerican literature. It's known for its incredible monumental architecture, such as the Temple of Kukulcán ("El Castillo"), a step pyramid honoring a feathered serpent deity. Around the spring and fall equinoxes, there is a distinctive light-and-shadow effect that creates the illusion of a serpent slithering down the staircase. There is also a <a href="https://www.salon.com/1999/09/15/quetzal/">well-known acoustical effect</a>: clap your hands at the base of the staircases and you'll get an echo that sounds eerily like a bird's chirp—perhaps mimicking the quetzal, a brightly colored exotic bird native to the region and prized for its long, resplendent tail feathers.</p>
<p>The Great Ball Court (one of 13 at the site) is essentially a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whispering_gallery">whispering gallery</a>: even though it is 545 feet long and 225 feet wide, a whisper at one end can be heard clearly at the other. The court features slanted benches with sculpted panels depicting aspects of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/study-the-maya-blessed-their-ball-courts-in-rituals-with-hallucinogenic-plants/">Maya ball games</a>—which were not just athletic events but also religious ones that often involved ritual sacrifices of players by decapitation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030127#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030127&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>I enjoyed riding the <a href="https://us.tenways.com/products/cgo800s?utm_source=tenways_country_redirect&amp;utm_medium=auto&amp;utm_campaign=europe2usa">Tenways CGO800S</a> far more once I stopped thinking of it as a bike, and more like the e-bike version of a reasonable four-door sedan.</p>
<p>It is a bike, to be sure. It has two wheels, handlebars, pedals, and a drivetrain between feet and rear cog. It's just not the kind of bike I'm used to. There are no gears to shift between, just a belt drive and five power modes. The ride is intentionally "Dutch-style" (from a Dutch company, no less), with a wide saddle and upright posture, and kept fairly smooth by suspension on the front fork. It ships with puncture-proof tires, sensible mud guards, and integrated lights. And its 350 W motor is just enough to make pedaling feel effortless, but you'll never quite feel like you're winning a race.</p>
<p>I also didn't feel like I was conquering the road when I was on the CGO800S so much as borrowing my aunt's car for an errand. The "Sky Blue" color helped cement the image of a modern-day Mercury Sable in my head. It's not meant for no-power riding, and its battery isn't a long-hauler, with a stated 53-mile range. It's comfortable, it's capable, and maybe we've long since reached the stage of the e-bike market where some bikes are just capital-F Fine, instead of them all being quirky experiments.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028674#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028674&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of the major data brokers engaged in the deeply alienating practice of selling detailed driver behavior data to insurers has shut down that business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verisk.com/solutions/underwriting-rating/personal-auto/">Verisk</a>, which had collected data from cars made by General Motors, Honda, and Hyundai, has stopped receiving that data, <a href="https://therecord.media/data-broker-shuts-product-driver-patterns">according to The Record</a>, a news site run by security firm Recorded Future. According to a statement provided to <a href="https://privacy4cars.com/">Privacy4Cars</a>, and reported by The Record, Verisk will no longer provide a "Driving Behavior Data History Report" to insurers.</p>
<p>Skeptics have long assumed that car companies had at least some plan to monetize the rich data regularly sent from cars back to their manufacturers, or telematics. But a concrete example of this was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html">reported by The New York Times' Kashmir Hill</a>, in which drivers of GM vehicles were finding insurance more expensive, or impossible to acquire, because of the kinds of reports sent along the chain from GM to data brokers to insurers. Those who requested their collected data from the brokers found details of every trip they took: times, distances, and every "hard acceleration" or "hard braking event," among other data points.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030993#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030993&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's X Corp. is reportedly demanding money from at least six Australians who were laid off, saying the company accidentally overpaid them. The Sydney Morning Herald <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/elon-musk-chases-overpayments-from-australia-s-sacked-twitter-staff-20240611-p5jku0.html">reported</a> today that "X is threatening to take some former Australian employees to court, demanding they return entitlements it claims were overpaid to them after it bungled the currency conversion from US to Australian dollars on the payments."</p>
<p>Emails sent this year by X's Asia Pacific human resources department to the laid-off employees said there was "a significant overpayment in error in January 2023." The alleged overpayments ranged from $1,500 to $70,000 for each employee.</p>
<p>So far, none of the former employees have repaid the money, The Sydney Morning Herald was told. One Australian dollar is currently worth $0.67 in US currency.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031020#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031020&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Hackers working for the Chinese government gained access to more than 20,000 VPN appliances sold by Fortinet using a critical vulnerability that the company failed to disclose for two weeks after fixing it, Netherlands government officials said.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-42475, is a heap-based buffer overflow that allows hackers to remotely execute malicious code. It carries a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10. A maker of network security software, Fortinet silently fixed the vulnerability on November 28, 2022, but failed to mention the threat until December 12 of that year, when the company <a href="https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-22-398">said</a> it became aware of an “instance where this vulnerability was exploited in the wild.” On January 11, 2023—more than six weeks after the vulnerability was fixed—Fortinet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/fortinet-says-hackers-exploited-critical-vulnerability-to-infect-vpn-customers/">warned</a> a threat actor was exploiting it to infect government and government-related organizations with advanced custom-made malware.</p>
<h2>Enter CoatHanger</h2>
<p>The Netherlands officials first <a href="https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc/documenten/publicaties/2024/februari/6/mivd-aivd-advisory-coathanger-tlp-clear/TLP-CLEAR+MIVD+AIVD+Advisory+COATHANGER.pdf">reported</a> in February that Chinese state hackers had exploited CVE-2022-42475 to install an advanced and stealthy backdoor tracked as CoatHanger on Fortigate appliances inside the Dutch Ministry of Defense. Once installed, the never-before-seen malware, specifically designed for the underlying FortiOS operating system, was able to permanently reside on devices even when rebooted or receiving a firmware update. CoatHanger could also escape traditional detection measures, the officials warned. The damage resulting from the breach was limited, however, because infections were contained inside a segment reserved for non-classified uses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030948#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030948&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will reportedly visit North Korea later this month, and you can bet collaboration on missiles and space programs will be on the agenda.</p>
<p>The bilateral summit in Pyongyang will follow a mysterious North Korean rocket launch on May 27, which ended in a fireball over the Yellow Sea. The fact that this launch fell short of orbit is not unusual—two of the country's three previous satellite launch attempts failed. But North Korea's official state news agency dropped some big news in the last paragraph of its report on the May 27 launch.</p>
