<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-what-redwood-learned-in-its-first-year-of-ev-battery-recycling/">Battery recycling company</a> Redwood Materials gained a new automaker partner today. It has agreed to a deal with BMW of North America to recycle lithium-ion battery packs from BMW's electrified vehicles and will eventually use recycled material from Redwood in battery packs for BMWs built in North America as the automaker works toward a closed-loop supply chain.</p>
<p>"Our partnership with BMW of North America ensures responsible end-of-life battery management that will improve the environmental footprint of lithium-ion batteries, help decrease cost and, in turn, increase access and adoption of electric vehicles," said Cal Lankton, chief commercial officer at Redwood Materials.</p>
<p>Redwood was founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel in 2017, and in recent years, the startup has signed partnerships with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/ford-volvo-and-redwood-materials-start-recycling-ev-batteries/">Ford, Volvo</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/volkswagen-partners-with-redwood-materials-to-recycle-ev-batteries/">Volkswagen</a>, and more recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/gm-to-recycle-10k-tons-of-ev-battery-materials-a-year-with-redwood-deal/">General Motors</a>. These companies route end-of-life battery packs (and, in the case of GM, battery manufacturing scraps) to Redwood, where the nickel, cobalt, copper, lithium, and other minerals are recycled in a hydrometallurgy facility.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050767#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050767&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">announced</a> they have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair, the makers of the heavily Pokémon-inspired <em>Palworld</em>. The Tokyo District Court lawsuit seeks an injunction and damages "on the grounds that <em>Palworld</em> infringes multiple patent rights" according to the announcement.</p>
<p>"Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years," the company writes.</p>
<p>The many surface similarities between <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Palworld</em> are readily apparent, even though Pocketpair's game adds many new features over Nintendo's (such as, uh, guns). But making legal hay over even heavy common ground between games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/game-makers-face-uphill-battle-proving-copyright-infringement-in-court/">can be an uphill battle</a>. That's because copyright law (at least in the US) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/06/defining-tetris-how-courts-judge-gaming-clones">generally doesn't apply to a game's mere design elements</a>, and only extends to "expressive elements" such as art, character design, and music.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050891#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050891&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the past few years, a conspiracy theory called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">Dead Internet theory</a>" has picked up speed as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT increasingly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/openai-hits-google-where-it-hurts-with-new-searchgpt-prototype/">generate</a> text and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/09/x-twitter-bots-republican-primary-debate-tweets-increase">social media interactions</a> found online. The theory says that most social Internet activity today is artificial and designed to manipulate humans for engagement.</p>

<p>On Monday, software developer Michael Sayman <a href="https://x.com/michaelsayman/status/1835841675584811239">launched</a> a new AI-populated social network app called <a href="https://socialai.co/">SocialAI</a> that feels like it's bringing that conspiracy theory to life, allowing users to interact solely with AI chatbots instead of other humans. It's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/socialai-ai-social-network/id6670229993">available</a> on the iPhone app store, but so far, it's picking up pointed criticism.</p>
<p>After its creator announced SocialAI as "<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">a private social network where you receive millions of AI-generated comments offering feedback, advice &amp; reflections on each post you make," computer security specialist Ian Coldwater <a href="https://x.com/IanColdwater/status/1835866398217629821">quipped</a> on X, "This sounds like actual hell." </span>Software developer and frequent AI pundit Colin Fraser <a href="https://x.com/colin_fraser/status/1836401313623474559">expressed</a> a similar sentiment: "I don’t mean this like in a mean way or as a dunk or whatever but this actually sounds like Hell. Like capital H Hell."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050587#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050587&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>After 20 years, it's now possible for solo players to finish storylines in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game <em>World of Warcraft</em> that previously required a group to do an intensive raid.</p>
<p>That's thanks to "<a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24137818/going-solo-in-world-of-warcraft-a-heros-journey">Story Mode</a>," a new raid difficulty that was added for the final wing of the first raid of the recently released <em>The War Within</em> expansion.</p>
<p>Over the years, developer Blizzard has expanded the difficulty options for raids to meet various players and communities where they're at in terms of play styles. The top difficulty is Mythic, where the semi-pro hardcore guilds compete. Below that is Heroic, where serious, capital-G gamers coordinate with friends in weekly raid schedules to progress. Then there's Normal, which still requires some coordination but isn't nearly as challenging and can typically be completed by a pick-up group within a few tries.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050728#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050728&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider two bills Thursday that would effectively nullify the Supreme Court's rulings against patents on broad software processes and human genes. Open source and Internet freedom advocates are mobilizing and pushing back.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tillis.senate.gov/services/files/4B41CBF2-57AB-4E8E-9E93-7D714A7AAB40">Patent Eligibility Restoration Act</a> (or PERA, S. 2140), sponsored by Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-Del.), would amend US Code such that "all judicial exceptions to patent eligibility are eliminated." That would include <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/573/208/">the 2014 ruling</a> in which the Supreme Court held, with Justice Clarence Thomas writing, that simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/supreme-court-smashes-do-it-on-a-computer-patents-in-9-0-opinion/">performing an existing process on a computer does not make it a new, patentable invention</a>. "The relevant question is whether the claims here do more than simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer," Thomas wrote. "They do not."</p>
<p>That case also drew on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/06/why-the-supreme-courts-software-patent-ban-didnt-last/2/"><em>Bilski v. Kappos</em></a>, a case in which a patent was proposed based solely on the concept of hedging against price fluctuations in commodity markets.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050585#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050585&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, AI video synthesis firm Runway and entertainment company Lionsgate <a href="https://runwayml.com/news/runway-partners-with-lionsgate">announced</a> a partnership to create a new AI model trained on Lionsgate's vast film and TV library. The deal will feed Runway legally clear training data and will also reportedly provide Lionsgate with tools to enhance content creation while potentially reducing production costs.</p>

<p>Lionsgate, known for franchises like John Wick and The Hunger Games, sees AI as a way to boost efficiency in content production. Michael Burns, Lionsgate's vice chair, <a href="https://runwayml.com/news/runway-partners-with-lionsgate">stated</a> in a press release that AI could help develop "cutting edge, capital efficient content creation opportunities." He added that some filmmakers have shown enthusiasm about potential applications in pre- and post-production processes.</p>
<p>Runway plans to develop a custom AI model using Lionsgate's proprietary content portfolio. The model will be exclusive to Lionsgate Studios, allowing filmmakers, directors, and creative staff to augment their work. While specifics remain unclear, the partnership marks the first major collaboration between Runway and a Hollywood studio.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050685#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050685&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The FBI has dismantled a massive network of compromised devices that Chinese state-sponsored hackers have used for four years to mount attacks on government agencies, telecoms, defense contractors, and other targets in the US and Taiwan.</p>
<p>The botnet was made up primarily of small office and home office routers, surveillance cameras, network-attached storage, and other Internet-connected devices located all over the world. Over the past four years, US officials said, 260,000 such devices have cycled through the sophisticated network, which is organized in three tiers that allow the botnet to operate with efficiency and precision. At its peak in June 2023, Raptor Train, as the botnet is named, consisted of more than 60,000 commandeered devices, according to researchers from Black Lotus Labs, making it the largest China state botnet discovered to date.</p>

<p>Raptor Train is the second China state-operated botnet US authorities have taken down this year. In January, law enforcement officials covertly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/chinese-malware-removed-from-soho-routers-after-fbi-issues-covert-commands/">issued commands</a> to disinfect Internet of Things devices that hackers backed by the Chinese government had taken over without the device owners’ knowledge. The Chinese hackers, part of a group tracked as Volt Typhoon, used the botnet for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/malware-turns-home-routers-into-proxies-for-chinese-state-sponsored-hackers/">more than a year</a> as a platform to deliver exploits that burrowed deep into the networks of targets of interest. Because the attacks appear to originate from IP addresses with good reputations, they are subjected to less scrutiny from network security defenses, making the bots an ideal delivery proxy. Russia-state hackers have also been caught assembling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/doj-turns-tables-on-russian-hackers-uses-their-malware-to-wipe-out-botnet/">large IoT botnets</a> for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/vpnfilter-malware-infecting-50000-devices-is-worse-than-we-thought/">same purposes</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050629#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050629&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Wireless communication devices have exploded again today across Lebanon in a second attack even deadlier than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/8-dead-2700-injured-after-simultaneous-pager-explosions-in-lebanon/">yesterday's explosion of thousands of Hezbollah pagers</a>. According to Lebanon's Ministry of Health, the new attack has killed at least 14 more people and injured more than 450.</p>
<p>Today's attack targeted two-way radios ("walkie-talkies") issued to Hezbollah members. The radios exploded in the middle of the day, with at least one going off during a funeral for people killed in yesterday's pager attacks. A New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas">report on that funeral</a> described the moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the blast went off, a brief, eerie stillness descended on the crowd. Mourners looked at one another in disbelief. The religious chants being broadcast over a loudspeaker abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>Then panic set in. People started scrambling in the streets, hiding in the lobbies of nearby buildings, and shouting at one another, “Turn off your phone! Take out the battery!” Soon a voice on the loudspeaker at the funeral urged everyone to do the same...</p>
<p>One woman, Um Ibrahim, stopped a reporter in the middle of the confusion and begged to use the reporter’s cellphone to call her children. The woman dialed a number with her hands shaking, then screamed into the phone, “Turn off your phones now!”</p></blockquote>
<p>The story appears to capture the current mood in Lebanon, where no one seems quite sure what will explode next. While today's attack against walkie-talkies is well-attested, various unconfirmed reports suggest that people fear an explosion from just about anything with a battery.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050740#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050740&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1934680/Age_of_Mythology_Retold/"><em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em></a> brings a lot of the usual advancements that you'd expect for a reboot of both <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/Ageofmythology/aom-1.html">the increasingly dated 2002 original game</a> and its <em>previous</em> reboot: 2014's Extended Edition, which is still perfectly playable and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/266840/Age_of_Mythology_Extended_Edition/">available on Steam</a>. The newest version of this real-time strategy classic comes with the requisite improvements in graphics and user interface, making the whole game much easier to look at and parse at a glance. And while the updated voice acting isn't going to win any awards, neither is the stilted, bare bones dialogue that those actors are working with (which seems faithful to the original game, for better or worse).</p>
<p>But <em>Retold</em> does add one thing that I wasn't really expecting in a modern real-time strategy game—full support for a handheld controller. Developers have been trying to make RTS games work without the traditional mouse and keyboard since the days of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1mbIXFV498">SNES <em>Populous</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2QAAWQMNuA"><em>Starcraft 64</em></a>, usually with limited success. Microsoft hasn't given up on the dream, though, fully integrating controller support for <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> into both the PC version (which we sampled) and, obviously, the Xbox Series X|S release.</p>
<p>The result is definitely the best version of an RTS controller interface that I've tried and proof that a modern controller can be a perfectly functional option for the genre. In the end, though, there are just a few too many annoyances associated with a handheld controller to make it the preferred way to play a game like this.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050669#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050669&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Four more large Internet service providers told the US Supreme Court this week that ISPs shouldn't be forced to aggressively police copyright infringement on broadband networks.</p>
<p>While the ISPs worry about financial liability from lawsuits filed by major record labels and other copyright holders, they also argue that mass terminations of Internet users accused of piracy "would harm innocent people by depriving households, schools, hospitals, and businesses of Internet access." The legal question presented by the case "is exceptionally important to the future of the Internet," they wrote in a brief <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cox-v.-Sony_Altice-et-al.-Amicus-Brief.pdf">filed with the Supreme Court</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>The <em>amici curiae</em> brief was filed by Altice USA (operator of the Optimum brand), Frontier Communications, Lumen (aka CenturyLink), and Verizon. The brief supports cable firm Cox Communications' attempt to overturn its loss in a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Sony. Cox <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/isp-to-supreme-court-we-shouldnt-have-to-disconnect-users-accused-of-piracy/">petitioned</a> the Supreme Court to take up the case last month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050677#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050677&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon currently faces disgruntled workers in every direction.</p>
<p>Office workers are raging against CEO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/amazon-kills-remote-working-tells-workers-to-be-in-office-5-days-a-week/">Andy Jassy's return to office mandate</a>, Fortune <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/amazon-andy-jassy-rto-mandate-employees-angry/">reported</a>—which came just as a leaked document reportedly showed that Amazon is also planning to gut management, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-fewer-managers-leaked-document-2024-9">reported</a>. Drivers by the hundreds are flocking to join a union to negotiate even better work conditions, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/hundreds-of-amazon-delivery-drivers-in-new-york-join-teamsters-union.html">reported</a>, despite some of the <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-delivery-service-partner-dsp-rate-increases-investment">biggest concessions in Amazon's history</a>. And hundreds more unionized warehouse workers are increasingly banding together nationwide to <a href="https://labornotes.org/2024/07/new-york-amazon-workers-demand-paid-juneteenth-holiday">demand a $25 an hour minimum wage</a>. On Wednesday, workers everywhere were encouraged to <a href="https://act.united4respect.org/a/make-call-warehouse-workers-deserve-living-wage">leave Jassy a voicemail</a> elevating workers' demands for a $25 minimum wage.</p>
<h2>Putting on the pressure</h2>
<p>This momentum has been building for years after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/teamsters-to-vote-thursday-on-sweeping-push-to-unionize-amazon-workers.html">drivers unionized in 2021</a>. And all this collective fury increasingly appears to be finally pressuring Amazon into negotiating better conditions for some workers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050684#p3">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050684&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/osYpGSz_0i4?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Robert Pattinson's character didn't read his contract's fine print in <em>Mickey 17</em>, director Bong Joon-ho's latest film. </p></div>
<p>It has been five long years since director Bong Joon-ho's film <em>Parasite</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/ars-technicas-best-films-of-2019/4/">topped Ars' list</a> for best films of the year, whose prior work on <em>Snowpiercer</em> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/07/new-netflix-film-okja-is-sci-fi-satire-so-sharp-it-will-cut-you/"><em>Okja</em></a> are also staff favorites. We're finally getting a new film from this gifted director: the sci-fi comedy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_17"><em>Mickey 17</em></a>, based on the 2022 novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey7"><em>Mickey7</em></a> by Edward Ashton. Judging by the trailer that recently dropped, it feels a bit like a darkly comic version of Duncan Jones' 2009 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(2009_film)"><em>Moon</em></a>, with a bit of the surreal absurdity of Terry Gilliam's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(1985_film)"><em>Brazil</em></a> (1985) thrown in for good measure. And the visuals are terrific.</p>
<p>Ashton's inspiration for the novel was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox">teletransportation paradox</a>—a thought experiment pondering the philosophy of identity that challenges certain notions of the self and consciousness. It started as a short story about what Ashton called "a crappy immortality" and expanded from there into a full-length novel.</p>
<p>Ashton <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/mickey7-edward-ashton-interview-bong-joon-ho-sci-fi/">told Nerdist</a> last year that Bong's adaptation would "change a lot of the book," but he considered the director a "genius" and wasn't concerned about those changes. The basic premise remains the same. Robert Pattinson plays the space colonist named Mickey Barnes, who is so eager to escape Earth that he signs up to be an "expendable" without reading the fine print.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050633#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050633&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A lawsuit is seeking to penalize Amazon for allegedly providing "fake list prices and purported discounts" to mislead people into buying Fire TVs.</p>
<p>As reported by Seattle news organization <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/class-action-lawsuit-claims-amazon-misled-consumers-with-fake-discounts/CY6QCIW4TBE7XI7VKAUTQUYZDI/">KIRO 7</a>, a lawsuit seeking class-action certification and filed in US District Court for the Western District of Washington on September 12 [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ramirez-v-amazon-com-inc-et-al-1.pdf">PDF</a>] claims that Amazon has been listing Fire TV and Fire TV bundles with "List Prices" that are higher than what the TVs have recently sold for, thus creating "misleading representation that customers are getting a 'Limited time deal.'" The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating Washington's<a href="https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.86"> Consumer Protection Act.</a></p>
<p>The plaintiff, David Ramirez, reportedly bought a 50-inch 4-Series Fire TV in February for $299.99. The lawsuit claims the price was listed as 33 percent off and a "Limited time deal" and that Amazon "advertised a List Price of $449.99, with the $449.99 in strikethrough text.” As of this writing, the 50-inch 4-Series 4K TV on Amazon is marked as having a "Limited time deal" of $299.98.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050596#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050596&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The supermassive black holes that sit at the center of galaxies aren't just decorative. The intense radiation they emit when feeding helps drive away gas and dust that would otherwise form stars, providing feedback that limits the growth of the galaxy. But their influence may extend beyond the galaxy they inhabit. Many black holes produce jets and, in the case of supermassive versions, these jets can eject material entirely out of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Now, researchers are getting a clearer picture of just how far outside of the galaxy their influence can reach. A new study describes the largest-ever jets observed, extending across a total distance of 23 million light-years (seven megaparsecs). At those distances, the jets could easily send material into other galaxies and across the cosmic web of dark matter that structures the Universe.</p>
<h2>Extreme jets</h2>
<p>Jets are formed in the complex environment near a black hole. The intense heating of infalling material ionizes and heats it, creating electromagnetic fields that act as a natural particle accelerator. This creates jets of particles that travel at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. These will ultimately slam into nearby material, creating shockwaves that heat and accelerate that, too. Over time, this leads to large-scale, coordinated outflows of material, with the scale of the jet being proportional to a combination of the size of the black hole and the amount of material it is feeding on.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050640#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050640&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Hawaiian island of Kauai may not have any spewing lava, but hikers along the magnificent Napali coast have brought their own volcanic action recently, violently hollowing their innards amid the gushing waterfalls and deeply carved valleys.</p>
<p>Between August and early September, at least 50 hikers fell ill with norovirus along the famed <a href="https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/hiking/kauai/kalalau-trail/">Kalalau Trail</a>, which has been closed since September 4 for a deep cleaning. The rugged 11-mile trail runs along the northwest coast of the island, giving adventurers breathtaking views of stunning sea cliffs and Kauai's lush valleys. It's situated just north of Waimea Canyon State Park, also known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific.</p>
<p>"It’s one of the most beautiful places in the world. I feel really fortunate to be able to be there, and appreciate and respect that land,” one hiker who fell ill in late August <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/09/17/norovirus-sickens-dozens-hawaii-hiking-trail-forcing-sites-closure/">told The Washington Post</a>. "My guts exploding all over that land was not what I wanted to do at all."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050415#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050415&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration alleged Tuesday that SpaceX violated its launch license requirements on two occasions last year by using an unauthorized launch control center and fuel farm at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>The regulator seeks to fine SpaceX $633,009 for the alleged violations, which occurred during a Falcon 9 launch and a Falcon Heavy launch last year. Combined, the proposed fines make up the largest civil penalty ever imposed by the FAA's commercial spaceflight division.</p>
<p>“Safety drives everything we do at the FAA, including a legal responsibility for the safety oversight of companies with commercial space transportation licenses,” said Marc Nichols, the FAA's chief counsel, in a statement. “Failure of a company to comply with the safety requirements will result in consequences.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050547#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050547&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've ever had an iPhone update go bad, you may have used <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118106">recovery mode</a> to resuscitate your device. A device booted into recovery mode can't do anything by itself, but it can be connected to a working Mac or PC with a cable, and that Mac or PC can download a fresh copy of iOS and all of your phone's related firmware to restore it to a factory-default state. You'll need a backup to recover your personal data, but it beats having to take a trip to an Apple Store or send your phone in for repairs.</p>

<p>The new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models launching this week apparently add a new option for phones that are in recovery mode: rudimentary wireless communication, so phones that need to be recovered can be placed near another iPhone or an iPad and be restored without using a cable, a PC, or Mac.</p>
<p>The new system was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/17/iphone-16-firmware-restored-wirelessly/">tested by 9to5Mac</a>, which says it uses "the same RecoveryOS that lets users restore Apple Watch and Apple TV firmware from an iPhone." When you place an iPhone 16 in recovery mode near another device, the functioning device will download the software and firmware files and then transfer them to the broken phone, where they can be installed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050576#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050576&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google has won an appeal against a €1.5 billion competition fine from the European Commission in a victory for the Big Tech group as it comes under growing scrutiny from Brussels regulators.</p>
<p>The EU’s General Court said on Wednesday that while it accepted “most of the commission’s assessments” that the company had used its dominant position to block rival online advertisers, it annulled the hefty fine levied against Google in the case.</p>
<p>When launching the action against Google in 2019, Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s competition chief, said that the search giant had imposed anti-competitive restrictions on third-party websites for a decade between 2006 and 2016. She justified the €1.5 billion fine by arguing that it reflected the “serious and sustained nature” of the infringement.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050580#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050580&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Starting today, electric vehicles made by General Motors gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network for the first time. GM signed a deal with Tesla <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/gms-evs-will-get-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-in-2024/">last June</a> to allow its customers access to more than 17,000 DC fast chargers around North America, following a similar deal by archrival Ford.</p>
<p>"Enabling access to even more publicly available fast chargers represents yet another way GM is focused on further improving the customer experience and making the transition to electric more seamless," said Wade Shaffer, VP of GM Energy.</p>
<p>GM's EVs, which include the bestselling Chevrolet Bolt as well as more recent Ultium-based EVs from Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC, will require an adapter to connect the Tesla J3400 (originally NACS) plug to their CCS1 charge ports.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050531#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050531&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The macOS 15 Sequoia update will inevitably be known as "the AI one" in retrospect, introducing, as it does, the first wave of "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/">Apple Intelligence</a>" features.</p>
<p>That's funny because none of that stuff is actually ready for the 15.0 release that's coming out today. A lot of it is coming "later this fall" in the 15.1 update, which Apple has been testing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/you-can-now-try-apple-intelligence-in-the-ios-macos-developer-beta/">entirely separately</a> from the 15.0 betas for weeks now. Some of it won't be ready until after <em>that</em>—rumors say image generation won't be ready until the end of the year—but in any case, none of it is ready for public consumption yet.</p>

<p>But the AI-free 15.0 release does give us a chance to evaluate all of the non-AI additions to macOS this year. Apple Intelligence is sucking up a lot of the media oxygen, but in most other ways, this is a typical 2020s-era macOS release, with one or two headliners, several quality-of-life tweaks, and some sparsely documented under-the-hood stuff that will subtly change how you experience the operating system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048298#p3">Read 214 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048298&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
