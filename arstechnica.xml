                            <![CDATA[<p>Some of the most ingenious tech has been inspired by nature. From color-changing materials that function like <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c17623">cephalopod skin</a> to a tiny biomimetic robot that looks and moves <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03801-0">like an actual cockroach</a>, the extraordinary adaptations of some organisms have upgraded our technological capabilities. Now the octopus is lending an arm—or a sucker.</p>
<p>Octopus tentacles have remarkably strong suckers with an adhesion power that could be an asset to soft robots that need to pick things up and hold onto them. Existing artificial suction cups have trouble with irregular surfaces such as rocks and shells. Cephalopods such as octopuses and squid have evolved biological suckers that can adapt to each surface and attach to them. This is why a team of researchers at the University of Bristol, led by Tianqi Yue, have created robotic suckers that are closer to the real thing than ever.</p>
<p>One reason biological suckers have an edge is mucus secretion, better enabling them to stick on an irregular surface. While robotic suckers can’t exactly go there, Yue figured out a way for them to use water instead of mucus.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/robotic-sucker-can-adapt-to-surroundings-like-an-actual-octopus/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Friday upheld a key provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires health plans to fully cover many preventive health care services recommended by a federal panel.</p>
<p>The ruling means that tens of millions of Americans can continue getting <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/">a variety of preventive services for free under their plans</a>. Those cost-free services include an array of screenings, such as cancer screenings like mammograms and colonoscopies, as well as screens for obesity, lead exposure in children, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some sexually transmitted diseases, to name a few. The free services also include recommended vaccines for children and adults, well-baby and well-child doctor visits, birth control, statins, PrEP HIV prevention drugs, and fluoride supplements and varnishes for children's teeth.</p>
<p>The ruling stems from a lawsuit brought by a group of conservative Christians, represented by Braidwood Management, who objected to having to cover PrEP medication, which they claim can "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/27/obamacare-preventive-care-supreme-court-appointments-decision/">encourage and facilitate homosexual behavior</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/critical-preventive-care-will-remain-free-under-aca-health-plans-scotus-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, software engineer Doug Brown <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2025/06/finding-a-27-year-old-easter-egg-in-the-power-mac-g3-rom/">published</a> his discovery of how to trigger a long-known but previously inaccessible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">Easter egg</a> in the Power Mac G3's ROM: a hidden photo of the development team that nobody could figure out how to display for 27 years. While Pierre Dandumont <a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/2014/08/19/easter-egg-les-images-cachees-dans-les-roms/">first documented</a> the JPEG image itself in 2014, the method to view it on the computer remained a mystery until Brown's reverse engineering work revealed that users must format a RAM disk with the text "secret ROM image."</p>
<p>Brown stumbled upon the image while using a hex editor tool called <a href="https://hexfiend.com/">Hex Fiend</a> with <a href="https://github.com/eharmon/rom_fiend">Eric Harmon's Mac ROM template</a> to explore the resources stored in the beige Power Mac G3's ROM. The ROM appeared in desktop, minitower, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/macintosh-at-40-the-oddest-and-rarest-macs-ever-built/">all-in-one G3 models</a> from 1997 through 1999.</p>
<p>"While I was browsing through the ROM, two things caught my eye," Brown wrote. He found both the HPOE resource containing the JPEG image of team members and a suspicious set of Pascal strings in the PowerPC-native SCSI Manager 4.3 code that included ".Edisk," "secret ROM image," and "The Team."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/after-27-years-engineer-discovers-how-to-display-secret-photo-in-power-mac-rom/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court today reversed a ruling that threatened the future of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund. In a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-354_0861.pdf">6–3 opinion</a>, the high court said the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit erred when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/5th-circuit-court-upends-fcc-universal-service-fund-ruling-it-an-illegal-tax/">found</a> that Universal Service fees on phone bills are an illegal tax.</p>
<p>Universal Service is an $8 billion-a-year system that is used to expand telecom networks and make access more affordable through programs such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/poor-americans-will-get-9-a-month-to-buy-broadband-or-mobile-data/">Lifeline</a> discounts and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/internet-providers-that-won-fcc-grants-try-to-escape-broadband-commitments/">deployment grants</a> for Internet service providers. The program was challenged in multiple circuits by <a href="https://consumersresearch.org/">Consumers' Research</a>, a nonprofit that fights "woke corporations," and a mobile virtual network operator called <a href="https://www.causebasedcommerce.com/">Cause Based Commerce</a>.</p>
<p>The 5th Circuit ruling focused on Congress delegating its taxing power to the FCC and the FCC then subdelegating that taxing power to the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), a private organization that administers the fund. In a 9–7 <em>en banc</em> ruling, the 5th Circuit found that "the <em>combination</em> of Congress's sweeping delegation to FCC and FCC's unauthorized subdelegation to USAC violates the Legislative Vesting Clause in Article I, § 1."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/supreme-court-saves-universal-service-fund-rules-fcc-fee-is-not-illegal-tax/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Smartphones contain a treasure trove of personal data, which makes them a worthwhile target for hackers. However, law enforcement is not above snooping on cell phones, and their tactics are usually much harder to detect. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/meet-the-machines-that-steal-your-phones-data/">Cell site simulators</a>, often called Stingrays, can trick your phone into revealing private communications, but a change in Android 16 could allow phones to detect this spying.</p>
<p>Law enforcement organizations have massively <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/07/judge-slams-fbi-for-improper-cellphone-search-stingray-use/">expanded the use of Stingray devices</a> because almost every person of interest today uses a cell phone at some point. These devices essentially trick phones into connecting to them like a normal cell tower, allowing the operator to track that device's location. The fake towers can also shift a phone to less secure wireless technology to intercept calls and messages. There's no indication this is happening on the suspect's end, which is another reason these machines have become so popular with police.</p>
<p>However, while surveilling a target, Stingrays can collect data from other nearby phones. It's not unreasonable to expect a modicum of privacy if you happen to be in the same general area, but sometimes police use Stingrays simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/county-sheriff-has-used-stingray-over-300-times-with-no-warrant/">because they can</a>. There's also evidence that cell simulators have been deployed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/dhs-to-senator-malicious-use-of-stingrays-is-a-real-and-growing-risk/">mysterious groups outside law enforcement</a>. In short, it's a <em>problem</em>. Google has had plans to address this security issue for more than a year, but a lack of hardware support has slowed progress. Finally, in the coming months, we will see the first phones capable of detecting this malicious activity, and Android 16 is ready for it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/future-android-phones-could-warn-you-about-data-stealing-fake-cell-towers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court today upheld a Texas law that requires age verification on porn sites, finding that the state's age-gating law doesn't violate the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1122_3e04.pdf">6–3 decision</a> delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas rejected an appeal by the Free Speech Coalition, an adult-industry lobby group. Pornhub <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/pornhub-blocks-all-texas-users-after-court-upholds-age-verification-law/">disabled its website in Texas</a> last year because of the state law.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority decided that the law should be reviewed under the standard of intermediate scrutiny "because it only incidentally burdens the protected speech of adults." The law "survives intermediate scrutiny because it 'advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests,'" the court said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/supreme-court-upholds-texas-porn-law-that-caused-pornhub-to-leave-the-state/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Food poisoning is never fun—and a lot of the time, it can seem quite forceful. Take the common gut-buster norovirus for example. It can ignite forces that might make jet propulsion researchers jealous. Victims may fear liftoff from a porcelain launch pad, or a vomitous blast with a reverse thrust that seems powerful enough to drop a military jet from the sky.</p>
<p>But then there are the rare illnesses that produce truly violent forces. Such was the case for one unfortunate man in China who made the near-fatal decision to eat some dubious street food.</p>
<p>It's unclear what the 59-year-old ate exactly—but it's a safe bet he'll never eat it again. Soon after, his innards vigorously ignited. According to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2500300">a case report in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, the man, in fact, vomited with so much explosive force that he blew apart his esophagus—the muscular tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/man-eats-dubious-street-food-ends-up-blowing-apart-his-gi-tract/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2024, corporate anti-malware provider CrowdStrike <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">pushed a broken update to millions of PCs and servers</a> running some version of Microsoft's Windows software, taking down systems that both companies and consumers relied on for air travel, payments, emergency services, and their morning coffee. It was a huge outage, and it caused days and weeks of pain as the world's permanently beleaguered IT workers brought systems back online, in some cases touching each affected PC individually to remove the bad update and get the systems back up and running.</p>
<p>The outage was ultimately CrowdStrike's fault, and in the aftermath of the incident, the company promised a long list of process improvements to keep a bad update like that from going out again. But because the outage affected Windows systems, Microsoft often had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/19/windows-outage-crowdstrike-cancellations-computer/">shared</a> and sometimes even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/microsoft-crowdstrike-outage-what-happened.html">top billing</a> in mainstream news coverage—another in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/microsoft-blamed-for-a-cascade-of-security-failures-in-exchange-breach-report/">a string of security-related embarrassments</a> that prompted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/microsoft-ties-executive-pay-to-security-following-multiple-failures-and-breaches/">CEO Satya Nadella</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/microsoft-in-damage-control-mode-says-it-will-prioritize-security-over-ai/">other executives</a> to promise that the company would refocus its efforts on improving the security of its products.</p>
<p>The CrowdStrike crash was possible partly due to how anti-malware software works in Windows. Security vendors and their AV products generally have access to the Windows kernel, the cornerstone of the operating system that sits between your hardware and most user applications. But most user applications don't have kernel access specifically because a buggy app (or one hijacked by malware) with kernel access can bring the entire system down rather than just affecting the app. The bad CrowdStrike update was bad mostly because it was being loaded so early in Windows' boot process that many systems couldn't check for and download CrowdStrike's fix before they crashed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-is-trying-to-get-antivirus-software-away-from-the-windows-kernel/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Comcast <a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-new-national-xfinity-internet-packages-unlimited-data-advanced-wifi-gateway">said</a> it is offering "four simple national Internet tiers that include unlimited data and the advanced Xfinity WiFi Gateway for one low monthly price." Customers whose current plans have data caps won't automatically get unlimited data and would have to switch to a new plan to remove that annoying limit from their accounts.</p>
<p>"Customers can repackage into one of our new plans that include unlimited data if they don't have it already with their existing plan," a Comcast spokesperson told Ars today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/stung-by-customer-losses-comcast-says-all-its-new-plans-have-unlimited-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.50 of the Rocket Report! We're nearly halfway through the year, and it seems like a good time to look back on the past six months. What has been most surprising to me in the world of rockets? First, I didn't expect SpaceX to have this much trouble with Starship Version 2. Growing pains are normal for new rockets, but I expected the next big hurdles for SpaceX to clear with Starship to be catching the ship from orbit and orbital refueling, not completing a successful launch. The state of Blue Origin's New Glenn program is a little surprising to me. New Glenn's first launch in January went remarkably well, beating the odds for a new rocket. Now, production delays are pushing back the next New Glenn flights. The flight of Honda's reusable rocket hopper also came out of nowhere a few weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>Isar raises 150 million euros. </b>German space startup Isar Aerospace has obtained 150 million euros ($175 million) in funding from an American investment company, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/german-space-startup-isar-aerospace-secures-150-million-euro-fund-2025-06-25/">Reuters reports</a>. The company, which specializes in satellite launch services, signed an agreement for a convertible bond with Eldridge Industries, it said. Isar says it will use the funding to expand its launch service offerings. Isar's main product is the Spectrum rocket, a two-stage vehicle designed to loft up to a metric ton (2,200 pounds) of payload mass to low-Earth orbit. Spectrum flew for the first time in March, but it failed moments after liftoff and fell back to the ground near its launch pad. Still, Isar became the first in a new crop of European launch startups to launch a rocket theoretically capable of reaching orbit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/rocket-report-spacexs-dustup-on-the-border-northrop-has-a-nozzle-problem/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The near miss by the large Apophis asteroid in April 2029 offers NASA a golden—and exceedingly rare—opportunity to observe such an object like this up close. Critically, the interaction between Apophis and Earth's gravitational pull will offer scientists an unprecedented chance to study the interior of an asteroid.</p>
<p>This is fascinating for planetary science, but it also has serious implications for planetary defense. In the future, were such an asteroid on course to strike Earth, an effective plan to deflect it would depend on knowing what the interior looks like.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/06/trump-budget-kills-nasas-golden-opportunity-to-see-a-killer-asteroid-up-close/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hackers are exploiting a maximum-severity vulnerability that has the potential to give them complete control over thousands of servers, many of which handle mission-critical tasks inside data centers, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is warning.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, carrying a severity rating of 10 out of a possible 10, resides in the AMI MegaRAC, a widely used firmware package that allows large fleets of servers to be remotely accessed and managed even when power is unavailable or the operating system isn't functioning. These motherboard-attached microcontrollers, known as baseboard management controllers (BMCs), give extraordinary control over servers inside data centers.</p>
<p>Administrators use BMCs to reinstall operating systems, install or modify apps, and make configuration changes to large numbers of servers without physically being on premises and, in many cases, without the servers being turned on. Successful compromise of a single BMC can be used to pivot into internal networks and compromise all other BMCs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/active-exploitation-of-ami-management-tool-imperils-thousands-of-servers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA's Space Launch System appears to have a finite shelf life. The Trump administration wants to cancel it after just three launches, while the preliminary text of a bill making its way through Congress would extend it to five flights.</p>
<p>But chances are low the Space Launch System will make it to nine flights, and if it does, it's questionable that it would reach that point before 2040. The SLS rocket is a core piece of NASA's plan to return US astronauts to the Moon under the Artemis program, but the White House seeks to cancel the program in favor of cheaper commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>For the second time in less than a week, NASA test-fired new propulsion hardware Thursday that the agency would need to keep SLS alive. Last Friday, a new liquid-fueled RS-25 engine ignited on a test stand at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The hydrogen-fueled engine is the first of its kind to be manufactured since the end of the Space Shuttle program. This particular RS-25 engine is assigned to power the fifth flight of the SLS rocket, a mission known as Artemis V.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/nasa-tested-a-new-sls-booster-that-may-never-fly-and-the-end-of-it-blew-off/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Regeneration is a trick many animals, including lizards, starfish, and octopuses, have mastered. Axolotls, a salamander species originating in Mexico, can regrow pretty much everything from severed limbs, to eyes and parts of brain, to the spinal cord. Mammals, though, have mostly lost this ability somewhere along their evolutionary path. Regeneration persisted, in a limited number of tissues, in just a few mammalian species like rabbits or goats.</p>
<p>“We were trying to learn how certain animals lost their regeneration capacity during evolution and then put back the responsible gene or pathway to reactivate the regeneration program,” says Wei Wang, a researcher at the National Institute of Biological Sciences in Beijing. Wang’s team has found one of those inactive regeneration genes, activated it, and brought back a limited regeneration ability to mice that did not have it before.</p>
<h2>Of mice and bunnies</h2>
<p>The idea Wang and his colleagues had was a comparative study of how the wound healing process works in regenerating and non-regenerating mammalian species. They chose rabbits as their regenerating mammals and mice as the non-regenerating species. As the reference organ, the team picked the ear pinna. “We wanted a relatively simple structure that was easy to observe and yet composed of many different cell types,” Wang says. The test involved punching holes in the ear pinna of rabbits and mice and tracking the wound-repairing process.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/changing-one-gene-can-restore-some-tissue-regeneration-to-mice/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The vaccine panel hand-selected by health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to drop federal recommendations for seasonal flu shots that contain the ethyl-mercury containing preservative thimerosal. The panel did so after hearing a misleading and cherry-picked presentation from an anti-vaccine activist.</p>
<p>There is extensive data from the last quarter century proving that the antiseptic preservative is safe, with no harms identified beyond slight soreness at the injection site, but none of that data was presented during today's meeting.</p>
<p>The significance of the vote is unclear for now. The vast majority of seasonal influenza vaccines currently used in the US—about 96 percent of flu shots in 2024–2025—do not contain thimerosal. The preservative is only included in multi-dose vials of seasonal flu vaccines, where it prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi potentially introduced as doses are withdrawn.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-s-cdc-panel-ditches-some-flu-shots-based-on-anti-vaccine-junk-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Now that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/book-authors-made-the-wrong-arguments-in-meta-ai-training-case-judge-says/">Meta has largely beaten an AI training copyright lawsuit</a> raised by 13 book authors—including comedian Sarah Silverman and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Diaz—the only matter left to settle in that case is whether Meta violated copyright laws by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">torrenting books used to train Llama models</a>.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kadrey-v-Meta-Order-6-25-25.pdf">order</a> that partly grants Meta's motion for summary judgment, judge Vince Chhabria confirmed that Meta and the authors would meet on July 11 to "discuss how to proceed on the plaintiffs’ separate claim that Meta unlawfully distributed their protected works during the torrenting process."</p>
<p>Chhabria's order suggested that authors may struggle to win this part of the fight, too, due to a lack of evidence, as there has not yet been much discovery on this issue that was raised so late in the case. But he also warned that Meta was wrong to argue its torrenting was completely "irrelevant" to whether its copying of books was fair use.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-rejects-metas-claim-that-torrenting-is-irrelevant-in-ai-copyright-case/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-powered-artifacts">announced</a> a new feature that expands its Artifacts document management system into the basis of a personal AI app gallery resembling something from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/the-rise-and-fall-of-adobe-flash/">Flash game era</a> of the early 2000s—though these apps run on modern web code rather than Adobe's defunct plugin.</p>
<p>Using plain English dialogue, users can build and share interactive applications <a href="https://claude.ai/artifacts">directly within</a> Claude's chatbot interface using a new API capability that lets artifacts interact with Claude itself. Claude is an AI assistant similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>Claude has been capable of building web apps for some time, but Anthropic has put renewed focus on the feature that many have overlooked. "I'm amused that Anthropic turned 'we added a window.claude.complete() function to Artifacts' into what looks like a major new product launch," <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/ai-powered-apps-with-claude/">wrote</a> independent AI researcher Simon Willison in a blog post, "but I can't say it's bad marketing for them to do that!"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-summons-the-spirit-of-flash-games-for-the-ai-age/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Broadcom stopped selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">VMware perpetual licenses</a> in November 2023 in favor of pushing a small number of VMware SKUs that feature multiple VMware offerings. Since Broadcom is forcefully bundling VMware products, the costs associated with running VMware have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/">skyrocketed</a>, with customers frequently citing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">300 percent price hikes</a> and some firms claiming even larger increases. As a result, some VMware users have opted to keep using VMware perpetual licenses, even though Broadcom refuses to renew <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/broadcom-tried-to-jack-vmware-prices-by-1050-percent-att-claims/">most</a> of those clients’ support services.</p>
<p>This year, Broadcom started sending such VMware users cease-and-desist letters [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025.05.07-12.26.01-SNAGIT-0038.pdf">PDF</a>], telling organizations to stop using any maintenance releases/updates, minor releases, major releases/upgrades extensions, enhancements, patches, bug fixes, or security patches (except for zero-day security patches) that VMware issued since the user’s support contract ended.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/vmware-perpetual-license-holder-receives-audit-letter-from-broadcom/">Read full article</a></p>
