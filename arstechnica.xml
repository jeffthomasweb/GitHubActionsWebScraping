<h2>A bad quarter</h2>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/tesla-sales-fell-by-9-percent-in-2025-its-second-yearly-decline/">Earlier this month</a>, Tesla revealed its sales and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2025, with a 16 percent decline compared to Q4 2024. Now we know the cost of those lost sales: Automotive revenues fell by 11 percent to $17.7 billion.</p>
<p>Happily for Tesla, double-digit growth in its energy storage business ($3.8 billion, an increase of 25 percent) and services ($3.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent) made up some of the shortfall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/2025-sees-teslas-annual-revenue-fall-for-the-first-time/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>RAMP—the predominantly Russian-language online bazaar that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed”—had its dark web and clear web sites seized by the FBI as the agency tries to combat the growing scourge threatening critical infrastructure and organizations around the world.</p>
<p>Visits to both sites on Wednesday returned pages that said the FBI had taken control of the RAMP domains, which mirrored each other. RAMP has been among the dwindling number of online crime forums to operate with impunity, following the takedown of other forums such as XSS, which saw its leader arrested <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/who-got-arrested-in-the-raid-on-the-xss-crime-forum/">last year</a> by Europol. The vacuum left RAMP as one of the leading places for people pushing ransomware and other online threats to buy, sell, or trade products and services.</p>
<h2>I regret to inform you</h2>
<p>“The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized RAMP,” a banner carrying the seals of the FBI and the Justice Department said. “This action has been taken in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.” The banner included a graphic that appeared on the RAMP site, before it was seized, that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/site-catering-to-online-criminals-has-been-seized-by-the-fbi/">Read full article</a></p>

Teachers and students can get the same apps for $3 a month, or $30 a year.</p>
<p>The bundle includes either access to or enhanced features for a total of 10 Apple apps, though the base versions of several of these are available for free to all Mac and iPad owners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Cut Pro</li>
<li>Logic Pro</li>
<li>Pixelmator Pro</li>
<li>Keynote, Pages, and Numbers</li>
<li>Freeform</li>
<li>Motion, Compressor, and MainStage (Mac only)</li>
</ul>
<p>When companies introduce a subscription-based model for long-standing apps with an established user base, they often shift <em>exclusively</em> to a subscription model, offering continuous updates in return for a more consistent revenue stream. But these aren't always popular with subscription-fatigued users, who have seen virtually all major paid software shift to a subscription model in the last 10 or 15 years, and who in recent years have had to deal with prices that are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/home-microsoft-365-plans-use-copilot-ai-features-as-pretext-for-a-price-hike/">continuously</a> being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/spotify-to-raise-subscription-prices-by-up-to-2-in-february/">ratcheted upward</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/seven-things-to-know-about-how-apples-creator-studio-subscriptions-work/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>BBC One has adapted William Golding's classic 1954 novel <em>Lord of the Flies</em> into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies_(TV_series)">new miniseries</a> and just dropped the first trailer. The book has been adapted for film three times since its publication and also inspired the Emmy-nominated TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowjackets_(TV_series)"><em>Yellowjackets</em></a> (renewed for its fourth and final season this year). This BBC miniseries apparently has the support of the Golding family and is expected to hew quite closely to the novel.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for t<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies">he 1954 novel</a> below.)</strong></p>
<p>Golding was inspired to write <em>Lord of the Flies</em> by a popular, pro-colonialism children's novel called <em>The Coral Island</em>, whose central theme was the civilizing influence of British colonial efforts and Christianity on a "savage" people. Golding wanted to write a book about children on an island who "behave the way children really would behave."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/bbcs-lord-of-the-flies-miniseries-gets-a-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX has made a new set of demands on state governments that would ensure Starlink receives federal grant money even when residents don't purchase Starlink broadband service.</p>
<p>SpaceX said it will provide "all necessary equipment" to receive broadband "at no cost to subscribers requesting service," which will apparently eliminate the up-front hardware fee for Starlink equipment. But SpaceX isn't promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas. SpaceX pledged to make broadband available for $80 or less a month, plus taxes and fees, to people with low incomes in the subsidized areas. For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its <a href="https://starlink.com/residential">website</a> range from $50 to $120 a month.</p>
<p>SpaceX's demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn't reserve "large portions" of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service. Moreover, SpaceX would not be responsible for ensuring that Starlink equipment is installed correctly at each customer location.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-demands-grant-money-from-states-even-when-residents-dont-buy-service/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge in Virginia <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26511850-order-1-27-26/">ruled</a> Tuesday that the City of Norfolk’s use of nearly 200 automated license plate readers (ALPRs) from Flock is constitutional and can continue, dismissing the entire case just days before a bench trial was set to begin.</p>
<p>The case, <i>Schmidt v. City of Norfolk</i>, was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/lawsuit-city-cameras-make-it-impossible-to-drive-anywhere-without-being-tracked/">originally filed in October 2024</a> by two Virginians who claimed that their rights were violated when the Flock network of cameras captured their cars hundreds of times, calling the entire setup a “dragnet surveillance program.”</p>
<p>However, in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26511850-order-1-27-26/">51-page ruling</a>, US District Court Judge Mark S. Davis disagreed, finding that the “...plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that Defendants’ ALPR system is capable of tracking the whole of a person’s movements.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/angry-norfolk-residents-lose-lawsuit-to-stop-flock-license-plate-scanners/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>According to "four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident," Gottumukkala's uploads of sensitive CISA contracting documents triggered multiple internal cybersecurity warnings designed to "stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks."</p>
<p>Gottumukkala's uploads happened soon after he joined the agency and sought special permission to use OpenAI's popular chatbot, which most DHS staffers are blocked from accessing, DHS confirmed to Ars. Instead, DHS staffers use approved AI-powered tools, like the agency's DHSChat, which "are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks," Politico reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/us-cyber-defense-chief-accidentally-uploaded-secret-government-info-to-chatgpt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On January 12, EA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/biowares-anthem-will-soon-be-completely-unplayable/">shut down the official servers for <em>Anthem</em></a>, making Bioware's multiplayer sci-fi adventure completely unplayable for the first time since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/">its troubled 2019 launch</a>. Last week, though, the <em>Anthem</em> community woke up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPx5SJHFvGM">a new video</a> showing the game at least partially loading on what appears to be a simulated background server.</p>
<p>The people behind that video—and the <em>Anthem</em> revival project that made it possible—told Ars they were optimistic about their efforts to coerce EA's temperamental Frostbite engine into running the game without access to EA's servers. That said, the team also wants to temper expectations that may have risen a bit too high in the wake of what is just a proof-of-concept video.</p>

<p>"People are getting excited [about the video], and naturally people are going to get their hopes up," project administrator Laurie told Ars. "I don't want to be the person that's going to have to deal with the aftermath if it turns out that we can't actually get anywhere."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/why-reviving-the-shuttered-anthem-is-turning-out-tougher-than-expected/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google began stuffing Gemini into its dominant Chrome browser several months ago, and today the AI is expanding its capabilities considerably. Google says the chatbot will be easier to access and connect to more Google services, but the biggest change is the addition of Google's autonomous browsing agent, which it has dubbed Auto Browse. Similar to tools like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/10/we-let-openais-agent-mode-surf-the-web-for-us-heres-what-happened/">OpenAI Atlas</a>, Auto Browse can handle tedious tasks in Chrome so you don't have to.</p>
<p>The newly unveiled Gemini features in Chrome are accessible from the omnipresent AI button that has been lurking at the top of the window for the last few months. Initially, that button only opened Gemini in a pop-up window, but Google now says it will default to a split-screen or "Sidepanel" view. Google confirmed the update began rolling out over the past week, so you may already have it.</p>
<p>You can still pop Gemini out into a floating window, but the split-view gives Gemini more room to breathe while manipulating a page with AI. This is also helpful when calling other apps in the Chrome implementation of Gemini. The chatbot can now access Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights right from the Chrome window. Google technically added this feature around the middle of January, but it's only talking about it now.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-begins-rolling-out-chromes-auto-browse-ai-agent-today/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, China approved imports of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips for three of its largest technology companies, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-gives-green-light-importing-first-batch-nvidias-h200-ai-chips-sources-say-2026-01-28/">reported</a>. ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent received approval to purchase more than 400,000 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/nvidia-introduces-its-most-powerful-gpu-yet-designed-for-accelerating-ai/">H200</a> chips in total, marking a shift in Beijing's stance after weeks of holding up shipments despite US export clearance.</p>
<p>The move follows Beijing's temporary halt to H200 shipments earlier this month after Washington <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/us-government-to-take-25-cut-of-amd-nvidia-ai-sales-to-china/">cleared exports</a> on January 13. Chinese customs authorities had told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-customs-agents-told-nvidias-h200-chips-are-not-permitted-sources-say-2026-01-14/">reported</a> earlier this month, even as Chinese technology companies placed orders for more than two million of the chips.</p>
<p>The H200, Nvidia's second most powerful AI chip after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">B200</a>, delivers roughly six times the performance of the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/nvidia-to-resume-china-ai-chip-sales-after-huang-meets-trump/">H20</a> chip, which was previously the most capable chip Nvidia could sell to China. While Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the H20's performance, they still lag far behind the H200.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/report-china-approves-import-of-high-end-nvidia-ai-chips-after-weeks-of-uncertainty/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The explosive measles outbreak in South Carolina has now reached <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak">789 cases</a>, breaking Texas's outbreak record last year of <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025">762 cases</a>, which at the time was the largest outbreak in the US since measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000. The country is at grave risk of losing its elimination status in the coming months due to continuous spread.</p>
<p>With Texas' outbreak last year—which spanned January to August and spread to additional states—the US saw the largest measles case total since 1991, with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html">2,255 confirmed cases</a>. Now, with South Carolina's unbridled outbreak, 2026 is already looking like it will be another record year.</p>
<p>Though South Carolina's outbreak began in October, the spread of the disease has dramatically accelerated this month, with cases jumping from 218 on December 28 to 789 on January 27.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/sc-measles-23-schools-hit-over-550-quarantined-as-outbreak-hits-record/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AMD has released three distinct generations of its 3D V-Cache technology, which initially appeared in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/04/review-ryzen-7-5800x3d-is-an-interesting-tech-demo-thats-hard-to-recommend/">Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a> in 2022. The kernel of the idea has remained the same throughout AMD's efforts: take an existing desktop processor design and graft 64MB of additional L3 cache onto it.</p>
<p>This approach disproportionately helps apps that benefit from more cache, particularly games, and the size of the boost that 3D V-Cache gives to game performance has always been enough to offset any downsides these chips have come with. In the four years since the 5800X3D was released, AMD also has steadily chipped away at those disadvantages, adding more CPU cores, improving power consumption and temperatures, and re-adding the typical Ryzen range of overclocking controls.</p>
<p>AMD's new Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which launches for $499 starting tomorrow, is the very definition of a mild upgrade. It's the year-old Ryzen 7 9800X3D but with an extra 400 MHz of turbo boost speed. That's it. That's the chip.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/review-amds-ryzen-7-9850x3d-is-a-little-faster-and-a-lot-more-power-hungry/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When King Charles VIII of France occupied Naples in 1495, his army of nearly 20,000 mercenaries became the ground zero of the “Great Pox,” the first massive venereal syphilis pandemic in Europe, which went on to cause up to 5 million deaths. For a long time, the siege of Naples was considered the first time syphilis entered European accounts and culture. “But the evolutionary history of <i>Treponema pallidum</i>, the lineage of bacteria including the one that causes syphilis, goes way deeper in time,” says Elizabeth Nelson, an anthropologist at Southern Methodist University.</p>
<p>Nelson and her colleagues found a 5,500-year-old <em>Treponema pallidum</em> genome in an individual excavated from a rock shelter in Colombia—a discovery that shows pathogens causing treponemal diseases like syphilis, bejel, or yaws are several millennia older than we thought. And this means we might have been thinking about the origins of syphilis in an entirely wrong way.</p>
<h2 class="p2">The blame game</h2>
<p>While the French occupation of Naples did not introduce syphilis to the world, it created the perfect storm that shaped the perception of this disease and its origins for centuries to come. The first ingredient of this storm was the French army and its leader. Charles VIII invaded Naples with a vast melting pot of brigands and mercenaries from all over Europe, including the French, Swiss, Poles, and Spaniards. The king himself wasn’t exactly the epitome of morality. Chroniclers like Johannes Burckard noted his “fondness of copulation” and reported that, once he’d been with a woman, he “cared no more about her” and immediately sought another partner—a behavior eagerly mirrored by his soldiers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/the-origin-story-of-syphilis-goes-back-far-longer-than-we-thought/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An open source AI assistant called Moltbot (formerly "Clawdbot") recently crossed 69,000 stars on <a href="https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot">GitHub</a> after a month, making it one of the fastest-growing AI projects of 2026. Created by Austrian developer <a href="https://steipete.me/">Peter Steinberger</a>, the tool lets users run a personal AI assistant and control it through messaging apps they already use. While some say it feels like the AI assistant of the future, running the tool as currently designed comes with serious security risks.</p>
<p>Among the dozens of unofficial AI bot apps that never rise above the fray, Moltbot is perhaps most notable for its proactive communication with the user. The assistant works with WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms. It can reach out to users with reminders, alerts, or morning briefings based on calendar events or other triggers. The project has drawn comparisons to Jarvis, the AI assistant from the Iron Man films, for its ability to actively attempt to manage tasks across a user's digital life.</p>
<p>However, we'll tell you up front that there are plenty of drawbacks to the still-hobbyist software: While the organizing assistant code runs on a local machine, the tool effectively requires a subscription to Anthropic or OpenAI for model access (or using an API key). Users can run local AI models with the bot, but they are currently less effective at carrying out tasks than the best commercial models. Claude Opus 4.5, which is Anthropic's flagship large language model (LLM), is a popular choice.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/viral-ai-assistant-moltbot-rapidly-gains-popularity-but-poses-security-risks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nearly half of the databases that public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were updating on a monthly basis have been frozen without notice or explanation, according to a<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04022"> study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The study—led by Janet Freilich, a law expert at Boston University, and Jeremy Jacobs, a medical professor at Vanderbilt University—examined the status of all CDC databases, finding a total of 82 that had, as of early 2025, been receiving updates at least monthly. But, of those 82, only 44 were still being regularly updated as of October 2025, with 38 (46 percent) having their updates paused without public notice or explanation.</p>
<p>Examining the databases' content, it appeared that vaccination data was most affected by the stealth data freezes. Of the 38 outdated databases, 33 (87 percent) included data related to vaccination. In contrast, none of the 44 still-updated databases relate to vaccination. Other frozen databases included data on infectious disease burden, such as data on hospitalizations from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-lets-cdc-vaccination-data-rot-dozens-of-databases-frozen/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There are reports that a legitimate Microsoft email address—which Microsoft explicitly says customers should add to their allow list—is delivering scam spam.</p>
<p>The emails originate from no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com, an address tied to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/">Power BI</a>. The Microsoft platform provides analytics and business intelligence from various sources that can be integrated into a single dashboard. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/end-user-subscribe?tabs=creator">Microsoft documentation</a> says that the address is used to send subscription emails to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/end-user-subscribe#use-group-email-aliases">mail-enabled security groups</a>. To prevent spam filters from blocking the address, the company advises users to add it to allow lists.</p>
<h2>From Microsoft, with malice</h2>
<p>According to an Ars reader, the address on Tuesday sent her an email claiming (falsely) that a $399 charge had been made to her. "It provided a phone number to call to dispute the transaction. A man who answered a call asking to cancel the sale directed me to download and install a remote access application, presumably so he could then take control of my Mac or Windows machine (Linux wasn’t allowed)," she said. The email, captured in the two screenshots below, looked like this:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/theres-a-rash-of-scam-spam-coming-from-a-real-microsoft-address/">Read full article</a></p>
