<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft will be delaying its controversial Recall feature again, according to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/">an updated blog post</a> by Windows and Devices VP Pavan Davuluri. And when the feature does return "in the coming weeks," Davuluri writes, it will be as a preview available to PCs in the Windows Insider Program, the same public testing and validation pipeline that all other Windows features usually go through before being released to the general populace.</p>

<p>Recall is a new Windows 11 AI feature that will be available on PCs that meet the company's requirements for its "Copilot+ PC" program. Copilot+ PCs need at least 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a neural processing unit (NPU) capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS). The first (and for a few months, only) PCs that will meet this requirement are all using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/">Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite Arm chips</a>, with compatible <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/intels-new-lunar-lake-chips-promise-big-gpu-and-npu-upgrades-minor-cpu-boosts/">Intel</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/amds-ryzen-ai-300-series-laptop-cpus-are-its-first-for-new-copilot-pcs/#:~:text=AMD-,AMD%27s%20Ryzen%20AI%20300%20series%20is%20its%20next%2Dgen%20laptop,to%20support%20Copilot%2B%20PC%20features.&amp;text=Ryzen%20AI%20300%20uses%20a,hasn%27t%20said%20much%20about.&amp;text=Only%20two%20high%2Dend%20processors,though%20others%20will%20surely%20follow.">AMD</a> processors following later this year. Copilot+ PCs ship with other generative AI features too, but Recall's widely-publicized security problems have sucked most of the oxygen out of the room so far.</p>
<p>The Windows Insider preview of Recall will still require a PC that meets the Copilot+ requirements, though <a href="https://github.com/thebookisclosed/AmperageKit">third-party scripts</a> may be able to turn on Recall for PCs without the necessary hardware. We'll know more when Recall makes its reappearance.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031624#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031624&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A juried photography contest has disqualified one of the images that was originally picked as a top three finisher in its new AI art category. The reason for the disqualification? The photo was actually taken by a human and <em>not</em> generated by an AI model.</p>
<p>The 1839 Awards <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1839awards/videos/677508984231701/">launched last year</a> as a way to "honor photography as an art form," with <a href="https://1839awards.com/judges">a panel of experienced judges</a> who work with photos at The New York Times, Christie's, and Getty Images, among others. The <a href="https://1839awards.com/faq/details?section=rules">contest rules</a> sought to segregate AI images into their own category as a way to separate out the work of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">increasingly impressive image generators</a> from "those who use the camera as their artistic medium," as <a href="https://1839awards.com/">the 1839 Awards site puts it</a>.</p>
<p>For the non-AI categories, the 1839 Awards rules note that they "reserve the right to request proof of the image not being generated by AI as well as for proof of ownership of the original files." Apparently, though, the awards did not request any corresponding proof that submissions in the AI category <em>were</em> generated by AI.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031577#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031577&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Famed polar explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a> famously defied the odds to survive the sinking of his ship, <em>Endurance</em>, which became trapped in sea ice in 1914. His luck ran out on his follow-up expedition; he died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1922 on board a ship called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(ship)">Quest</a>.</em> The ship survived that expedition and sailed for another 40 years, eventually sinking in 1962 after its hull was pierced by ice on a seal-hunting run. Shipwreck hunters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/world/canada/ernest-shackleton-quest-ship-found.html">have now located</a> the remains of the converted Norwegian sealer in the Labrador Sea, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The wreckage of <em>Endurance</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/long-lost-endurance-shipwreck-found-off-coast-of-antarctica/">was found</a> in pristine condition in 2022 at the bottom of the Weddell Sea.</p>
<p>The <em>Quest</em> expedition's relatively minor accomplishments might lack the nail-biting drama of the <em>Endurance</em> saga, but the wreck is nonetheless historically significant. "His final voyage kind of ended that Heroic Age of Exploration, of polar exploration, certainly in the south," renowned shipwreck hunter David Mearns, who directed the operation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvv2w2e69go">told the BBC</a>. "Afterwards, it was what you would call the scientific age. In the pantheon of polar ships, <em>Quest</em> is definitely an icon."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/long-lost-endurance-shipwreck-found-off-coast-of-antarctica/">previously reported</a>, <em>Endurance</em> set sail from Plymouth, Massachusetts, on August 6, 1914, with Shackleton joining his crew in Buenos Aires, Argentina. By January 1915, the ship had become hopelessly locked in sea ice, unable to continue its voyage. For 10 months, the crew endured the freezing conditions, waiting for the ice to break up. The ship's structure remained intact, but by October 25, Shackleton realized <em>Endurance</em> was doomed. He and his men opted to camp out on the ice some two miles (3.2 km) away, taking as many supplies as they could with them.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031103#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031103&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The development of gene editing tools, which enable the specific targeting and correction of mutations, hold the promise of allowing us to correct those mutations that cause genetic diseases. However, the technology has been around for a while now—two researchers were critical to its development in 2020—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/gene-editing-tool-gets-its-inevitable-nobel/">and there have been only a few cases</a> where gene editing has been used to target diseases.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is the challenge of targeting specific cells in a living organism. Many genetic diseases affect only a specific cell type, such as red blood cells in sickle cell anemia, or specific tissue. Ideally, to limit potential side effects, we'd like to ensure that enough of the editing takes place in the affected tissue to have an impact, while minimizing editing elsewhere to limit side effects. But our ability to do so has been limited. Plus, a lot of the cells affected by genetic diseases are mature and have stopped dividing. So, we either need to repeat the gene editing treatments indefinitely or find a way to target the stem cell population that produces the mature cells.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a US-based research team said that they've done gene editing experiments that targeted a high-profile genetic disease: cystic fibrosis. Their technique largely targets the tissue most affected by the disease (the lung), and occurs in the stem cell populations that produce mature lung cells, ensuring that the effect is stable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031527#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031527&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla shareholders have re-approved CEO Elon Musk's $44.9 billion pay package, the company announced today. "Our stockholders have approved the ratification of the 100 percent performance-based stock option award to Elon Musk that was approved by stockholders in 2018," Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla's general counsel and corporate secretary, announced at Tesla's annual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=remZ1KMR_Z4">shareholder meeting</a>.</p>
<p>Ehrhart also said that shareholders approved a corporate move from Delaware to Texas, and the re-election of board members James Murdoch and Kimbal Musk (Elon Musk's brother). While the official announcement was made at the shareholder meeting late in the day on Thursday, Musk revealed that the yes votes were winning in a social media post last night.</p>
<p>"Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!" <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1801084780035154058">Musk wrote</a>, referring to the pay vote and the move from Delaware to Texas. His post included charts indicating that both shareholder resolutions had more than enough yes votes to surpass the "guaranteed win" threshold.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031288#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031288&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            Much of the time, the game looks a lot like <em>Civilization</em>, like in this city view.                          [credit:

<p>We haven't written much about <em>Ara: History Untold</em>, a new historical turn-based strategy PC game that's been in the works for a few years now. Part of that's because its publisher, Xbox Game Studios, hasn't put much fanfare behind it; it wasn't even mentioned in Microsoft's not-E3 extravaganza last week.</p>
<p>But perhaps both we and Microsoft should be putting more of a spotlight on it, given that it now has a release date: September 24, 2024. The game will be released on Steam and Xbox Game Pass for PC simultaneously.</p>
<p>The date was announced during an Official Xbox Podcast interview (and accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/">blog post</a>) with Marc Meyer, president of Oxide Games, the studio developing <em>Ara</em>. The podcast covered more than just the release date, though, with Meyer offering up some new gameplay details—particularly about how multiplayer will work.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031511#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031511&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last month, Wells Fargo terminated over a dozen bank employees following an investigation into claims of faking work activity on their computers, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-13/wells-fires-over-a-dozen-for-simulation-of-keyboard-activity">Bloomberg report</a>.</p>
<p>A Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) search conducted by Ars confirmed that the fired members of the firm's wealth and investment management division were "discharged after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work."</p>

<p>A rise in remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/employee-surveillance-is-on-the-rise-that-could-backfire-on-employers.html">remote worker surveillance</a> techniques, especially those using software installed on machines that keeps track of activity and reports back to corporate management. It's worth noting that the Bloomberg report says the FINRA filing does not specify whether the fired Wells Fargo employees were simulating activity at home or in an office.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031452#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031452&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft is pivoting its company culture to make security a top priority, President Brad Smith testified to Congress on Thursday, promising that security will be "more important even than the company’s work on artificial intelligence."</p>
<p>Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, "has taken on the responsibility personally to serve as the senior executive with overall accountability for Microsoft’s security," Smith told Congress.</p>
<p>His testimony comes after Microsoft admitted that it could have taken steps to prevent two aggressive nation-state cyberattacks from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/09/hack-of-a-microsoft-corporate-account-led-to-azure-breach-by-chinese-hackers/">China</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/us-government-strikes-back-at-kremlin-for-solarwinds-hack-campaign/">Russia</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031477#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031477&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>C:S2</em> has solutions to high rent, at least for their virtual citizens. They removed the "virtual landlord" that takes in rent, so now a building's upkeep is evenly split among renters.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, Apple announced it would be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-integrates-chatgpt-into-siri-ios-and-mac-os/">integrating</a> OpenAI's ChatGPT AI assistant into upcoming versions of its iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems. It paves the way for future third-party AI model integrations, but given Google's multi-billion-dollar <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/google-deal-may-have-kept-apple-from-building-search-engine-exec-says/">deal with Apple</a> for preferential web search, the OpenAI announcement inspired speculation about who is paying whom. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash">Bloomberg report</a> published Wednesday, Apple considers ChatGPT's placement on its devices as compensation enough.</p>

<p>"Apple isn’t paying OpenAI as part of the partnership," writes Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, citing people familiar with the matter who wish to remain anonymous. "Instead, Apple believes pushing OpenAI’s brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments."</p>
<p>The Bloomberg report states that neither company expects the agreement to generate meaningful revenue in the short term, and in fact, the partnership could burn extra money for OpenAI, because it pays Microsoft to host ChatGPT's capabilities on its Azure cloud. However, OpenAI could benefit by converting free users to paid subscriptions, and Apple potentially benefits by providing easy, built-in access to ChatGPT during a time when its own in-house LLMs are still catching up.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031318#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031318&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gamers of a certain age may remember Nintendo's Game &amp; Watch line, which predated the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/game-boy-20th-anniversary/">cartridge-based Game Boy</a> by offering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/play-tamagotchi-mc-hammer-and-more-lcd-handheld-wonders-in-your-browser/">simple, single-serving LCD games</a> that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/rare-nintendo-game-watch-unit-fetches-9000-at-auction/">fetch a pretty penny at auction today</a>. But even most ancient gamers probably don't remember Mego's "Time Out" line, which took the internal of Nintendo's early Game &amp; Watch titles and rebranded them for an American audience that hadn't yet heard of the Japanese game maker.</p>
<p>Now, the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has helped preserve <a href="https://gamehistory.org/mego-time-out-commercial/">the original film of an early Mego Time Out commercial</a>, marking the recovered, digitized video as "what we believe is the first commercial for a Nintendo product in the United States." The 30-second TV spot—which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xVT5i1muxE">now available in a high-quality digital transfer</a> for the first time—provides a fascinating glimpse into how marketers positioned some of Nintendo's earliest games to a public that still needed to be sold on the very idea of portable gaming.</p>

<p>An Indiana cop has resigned after it was revealed that he frequently used Clearview AI facial recognition technology to track down social media users not linked to any crimes.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://city-countyobserver.com/443846-2/">press release</a> from the Evansville Police Department, this was a clear "misuse" of Clearview AI's controversial face scan tech, which some US cities have banned over concerns that it gives law enforcement unlimited power to track people in their daily lives.</p>
<p>To help identify suspects, police can scan what Clearview AI describes on its website as "the world's largest facial recognition network." The database pools more than 40 billion images collected from news media, mugshot websites, public social media, and other open sources.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031338#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031338&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a case that<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/a-deep-dive-into-the-scotus-abortion-pill-case-and-whats-at-stake-for-the-fda/"> threatened to remove or at least restrict access to mifepristone</a>, a pill approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medication abortions and used in miscarriage care. The drug has been used for decades, racking up a remarkably good safety record in that time. It is currently used in the majority of abortions in the US.</p>
<p>The high court found that the anti-abortion medical groups that legally challenged the FDA's decision to approve the drug in 2000 and then ease usage restrictions in 2016 and 2021 simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/abortion-pill-case-scotus-skeptical-of-anti-abortion-groups-legal-standing/">lacked standing</a> to challenge any of those decisions. That is, the groups failed to demonstrate that they were harmed by the FDA's decision and therefore had no grounds to legally challenge the government agency's actions. The ruling tracks closely with comments and questions the justices raised during oral arguments in March.</p>
<p>"Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used <em>by others</em>," the Supreme Court noted in its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-235_n7ip.pdf">opinion</a>, which included the emphasis on "by others." The court summarized that the groups offered "complicated causation theories to connect FDA’s actions to the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries in fact," and the court found that "none of these theories suffices" to prove harm.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031323#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031323&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Victor Miller is running for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, with an unusual campaign promise: If elected, he will <i>not be</i> calling the shots—an AI bot will. VIC, the Virtual Integrated Citizen, is a ChatGPT-based chatbot that Miller created. And Miller says the bot has better ideas—and a better grasp of the law—than many people currently serving in government.</p>
<p>“I realized that this entity is way smarter than me, and more importantly, way better than some of the outward-facing public servants I see,” he says. According to Miller, VIC will make the decisions, and Miller will be its “meat puppet,” attending meetings, signing documents, and otherwise doing the corporeal job of running the city.</p>
<p>But whether VIC—and Victor—will be allowed to run at all is still an open question.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031255#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031255&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="bolded">hen Ina Chung,</span> a Colorado mother, first fed packaged foods to her infant, she was careful to read the labels. Her daughter was allergic to peanuts, dairy, and eggs, so products containing those ingredients were out. So were foods with labels that said they <em>may contain</em> the allergens.</p>
<p>Chung felt like this last category suggested a clear risk that wasn’t worth taking. “I had heard that the ingredient labels were regulated. And so I thought that that included those statements,” said Chung. “Which was not true.”</p>
<p>Precautionary allergen labels like those that say "processed in a facility that uses milk" or "may contain fish" are meant to address the potential for cross-contact. For instance, a granola bar that doesn’t list peanuts as an ingredient could still say they <em>may</em> be included. And in the United States, these warnings are not regulated; companies can use whatever precautionary phrasing they choose on any product. Some don’t bother with any labels, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jaoac/article/101/1/23/5653903">even in facilities</a> where unintended allergens slip in; others list allergens that may pose little risk. Robert Earl, vice president of regulatory affairs at Food Allergy Research &amp; Education, or <a href="https://www.foodallergy.org/">FARE</a>, a nonprofit advocacy, research, and education group, has even seen such labels that include all nine common food allergens. “I would bet my bottom dollar not all of those allergens are even in the facility,” he said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031214#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031214&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Roku TV owners have been introduced to a number of annoyances recently through the software update pipeline. There was an arbitration-demanding terms of service that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/disgraceful-messy-tos-update-allegedly-locks-roku-devices-until-users-give-in/">locked your TV until you agreed</a> (or mailed a letter). There is the upcoming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/roku-ad-push-continues-with-plans-to-put-video-ads-in-os-home-screen/">introduction of ads to the home screen</a>. But the latest irritation hits some Roku owners right in the eyes.</p>
<p>Reports on <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Discussions/Motion-Smoothing-out-of-nowhere/m-p/974654">Roku's community forums</a> and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1ddywvp/tcl_has_action_smoothing_out_of_the_blue/">Reddit</a> find owners of TCL HDTVs, on which Roku is a built-in OS, experiencing "motion smoothing" without having turned it on after updating to Roku OS 13. Some people are reporting that their TV never offered "Action Smoothing" before, but it is now displaying the results with no way to turn it off. Neither the TV's general settings, nor the specific settings available while content is playing, offer a way to turn it off, according to some users.</p>
<p>"Action smoothing" is Roku's name for video interpolation, or motion smoothing. The heart of motion smoothing is Motion Estimation Motion Compensation (MEMC). Fast-moving video, such as live sports or intense action scenes, can have a "juddery" feeling when shown on TVs at a lower frame rate. Motion smoothing uses MEMC hardware and algorithms to artificially boost the frame rate of a video signal by creating its best guess of what a frame between two existing frames would look like and then inserting it to boost the frame rate.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031173#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031173&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Saturday, Turkish police arrested and detained a prospective university student who is accused of developing an elaborate scheme to use AI and hidden devices to help him cheat on an important entrance exam, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/turkish-student-arrested-using-ai-cheat-university-exam-2024-06-11/">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13519405/Turkish-student-used-AI-software-cheat-university-exam-disguising-camera-shirt-button-hiding-router-shoe-jailed.html">The Daily Mail</a>.</p>
<p>The unnamed student is reportedly jailed pending trial after the incident, which took place in the southwestern province of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isparta">Isparta</a>, where the student was caught behaving suspiciously during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Selection_and_Placement_System">TYT</a>. The TYT is a nationally held university aptitude exam that determines a person's eligibility to attend a university in Turkey—and cheating on the high-stakes exam is a serious offense.</p>
<p>According to police reports, the student used a camera disguised as a shirt button, connected to AI software via a "router" (possibly a mistranslation of a cellular modem) hidden in the sole of their shoe. The system worked by scanning the exam questions using the button camera, which then relayed the information to an unnamed AI model. The software generated the correct answers and recited them to the student through an earpiece.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031012#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031012&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>You can now buy a Starlink satellite dish for $299 (plus shipping and tax) in 28 US states due to a discount for areas where SpaceX's broadband network has excess capacity.</p>
<p>Starlink had raised its upfront hardware cost from $499 to $599 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/starlink-hikes-prices-to-599-up-front-and-110-per-month-blames-inflation/">in March 2022</a> but cut the <a href="https://www.starlink.com/service-plans">standard price</a> back down to $499 this week. In the 28 states where the network has what SpaceX deems excess capacity, a $200 discount is being applied to bring the price down to $299. It's unclear how long the deal will last, though we can assume the number of states eligible for $299 pricing will fall if a lot of people sign up.</p>
<p>"In the United States, new orders in certain regions are eligible for a one-time savings in areas where Starlink has abundant network availability," a <a href="https://support.starlink.com/?topic=efa87a10-aa1d-783a-ae80-0e1425041708">support page</a> posted yesterday said. "$200 will be removed from your Starlink kit price when ordering on Starlink.com and if activated after purchasing from a retailer, a $200 credit will be applied. The savings are only available for Residential Standard service in these designated regional savings areas."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031158#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031158&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Wednesday, Stability AI released weights for <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-medium">Stable Diffusion 3 Medium</a>, an AI image-synthesis model that turns text prompts into AI-generated images. Its arrival has been ridiculed online, however, because it generates images of humans in a way that seems like a step backward from other state-of-the-art image-synthesis models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/a-crazy-update-midjourney-v6-upgrade-heaps-on-ai-generated-detail/">Midjourney</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">DALL-E 3</a>. As a result, it can churn out wild anatomically incorrect visual abominations with ease.</p>

<p>A thread on Reddit, titled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1de7lbg/is_this_release_supposed_to_be_a_joke_sd32b/">Is this release supposed to be a joke? [SD3-2B],</a>" details the spectacular failures of SD3 Medium at rendering humans, especially human limbs like hands and feet. Another thread, titled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1de85nc/why_is_sd3_so_bad_at_generating_girls_lying_on/">Why is SD3 so bad at generating girls lying on the grass?</a>" shows similar issues, but for entire human bodies.</p>
<p>Hands have traditionally been a challenge for AI image generators due to lack of good examples in early training data sets, but more recently, several image-synthesis models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ai-imager-midjourney-v5-stuns-with-photorealistic-images-and-5-fingered-hands/">seemed to have overcome the issue</a>. In that sense, SD3 appears to be a huge step backward for the image-synthesis enthusiasts that gather on Reddit—especially compared to recent Stability releases like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/stable-diffusion-turbo-xl-accelerates-image-synthesis-with-one-step-generation/">SD XL Turbo</a> in November.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031050#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031050&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-reshapes-fitbit-in-its-image-as-users-allege-planned-obsolescence/">continued abuse</a> of the Fitbit brand is continuing with the shutdown of the web dashboard. Fitbit.com used to be both a storefront and a way for users to get a big-screen UI to sift through reams of fitness data. The store <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/27/fitbit-google-store-replaced/">closed up shop</a> in April, and now the web dashboard <a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-com-Dashboard/Fitbit-com-web-dashboard-is-transitioning-to-the-Fitbit-app/td-p/5613159">is dying</a> in July.</p>
<p>In a post on the "Fitbit Community" forums, the company said: "Next month, we’re consolidating the Fitbit.com dashboard into the Fitbit app. The web browser will no longer offer access to the Fitbit.com dashboard after July 8, 2024." That's it. There's no replacement or new fitness thing Google is more interested in; web functionality is just being removed. Google, we'll remind you, used to be a web company. Now it's a phone app or nothing. Google did the same thing to its Google Fit product <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-fit-website-to-close-on-march-19-shifting-focus-to-mobile-and-smartwatch/">in 2019</a>, killing off the more powerful website in favor of an app focus.</p>
<p>Dumping the web app leaves a few holes in Fitbit's ecosystem. The Fitbit app doesn't support big screens like tablet devices, so this is removing the only large-format interface for data. Fitbit's competitors all have big-screen interfaces. Garmin has a <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/">very similar</a> website, and the Apple Watch has <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/get-started-with-health-ipadf82bbc87/ipados">an iPad health app</a>. This isn't an improvement. To make matters worse, the app does not have the features of the web dashboard, with many of the <em>livid</em> comments in the forums <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/1ddm7yp/fitbitcom_web_dashboard_shutting_down_in_july/">on Reddit</a> calling out the app's deficiencies in graphing, achievement statistics, calorie counting, and logs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030992#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030992&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
