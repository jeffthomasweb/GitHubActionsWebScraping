<p>The Federal Aviation Administration has signaled to SpaceX that it won't approve a launch license for the next test flight of the Starship rocket until at least late November, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This is more than two months later than the mid-September timeframe the FAA previously targeted for determining whether to approve a launch license for the next Starship flight. SpaceX says the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage for the next launch—the fifth full-scale test flight of the Starship program—have been ready to launch since the first week of August.</p>
<p>"The flight test will include our most ambitious objective yet: attempt to return the Super Heavy booster to the launch site and catch it in mid-air," <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates/#starships-fly">SpaceX said in a statement</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048838#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048838&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nevada will soon become the first state to use AI to help speed up the decision-making process when ruling on appeals that impact people's unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>The state's Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation (DETR) agreed to pay Google $1,383,838 for the AI technology, a 2024 <a href="https://budget.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/budgetnvgov/content/Meetings/Board_of_Examiners/2024/8-13-2024_BOE_Packet.pdf">budget document</a> shows, and it will be launched within the "next several months," Nevada officials <a href="https://gizmodo.com/googles-ai-will-help-decide-whether-unemployed-workers-get-benefits-2000496215">told Gizmodo</a>.</p>
<p>Nevada's first-of-its-kind AI will rely on a Google cloud service called Vertex AI Studio. Connecting to Google's servers, the state will fine-tune the AI system to only reference information from DETR's database, which officials think will ensure its decisions are "more tailored" and the system provides "more accurate results," Gizmodo reported.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048889#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048889&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap">





<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US government recently announced multiple charges against the alleged leaders of the "Terrorgram Collective," which does just what it sounds like—it promotes terrorism on the Telegram messaging platform. In this case, the terrorism was white racial terror, complete with a "hit list" of US officials and activists, a homemade "White Terror" video glorifying "saints" who had killed others, and instructions for taking down US infrastructure such as electrical substation transformers. (Read <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1366641/dl?inline">the indictment</a>.)</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img right medium"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sainthood.jpg"><img alt="The group's criteria for &quot;sainthood.&quot;" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sainthood-300x203.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sainthood-640x434.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sainthood.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">The group's criteria for "sainthood."</a> </p></div>
<p>Chaos was the point. Terrorgram promoted "white supremacist accelerationism," which believes that society must be incited into a civil war or apocalyptic confrontation in order to bring down the existing system of government and establish a white nationalist state.</p>
<p>The group's manifestos and chat rooms sometimes felt suffused with the habits of the extremely online: hand-clap emojis between every important word, instructional videos on how to make bombs, the language of trolling, catchphrases so over the top they sound ironic ("HAIL HOLY TERROR" in all caps).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048921#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048921&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The human body is full of marvels, some even bordering on miraculous. That includes the limited ability for nerves to regenerate after injuries, allowing people to regain some function and feeling. But that wonder can turn, well, unnerving when those regenerated wires end up in a jumble.</p>
<p>Such is the case for a rare neurological condition called gustatory hyperhidrosis, also known as Frey's syndrome. In this disorder, nerves regenerate after damage to either of the large saliva glands that sit on either side of the face, just in front of the ears, called the parotid glands. But that nerve regrowth goes awry due to a quirk of anatomy that allows the nerves that control saliva production for eating to get tangled with those that control sweating for temperature control.</p>
<p>In this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2404232?logout=true">doctors in Taiwan report an unusual presentation of the disorder</a> in a 76-year-old woman. She told doctors that, for two years, every time she ate, her face would begin profusely sweating. In the clinic, the doctors observed the phenomenon themselves. They watched as she took a bite of pork jerky and began chewing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048913#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048913&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/mate-xt-ultimate-design/">Huawei's Mate XT Ultimate</a> is a phone that does not flip or fold, at least in the way of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-the-future-is-an-ugly-disappointment/">Samsung</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/">Google</a> contemporaries. You could say it collapses, really, across two hinges, from a full 10.2-inch diagonal rectangle (about a half-inch short of a standard iPad) down to a traditional 6.4-inch rectangle phone slab. There's also an in-between single-fold configuration at 7.9 inches. And there's an optional folding keyboard.</p>
<p>This phone, which Huawei calls a "trifold," would cost you the USD equivalent of $2,800 (19,999 yuan) if you could buy it in the US. Most notably, the phone launched just hours after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/iphone-16-gets-two-new-buttons-and-a-new-camera-look/">Apple's iPhone 16 event</a>. As noted by The New York Times, Huawei's product launches are often timed for maximum pushback against the US, which has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/huaweis-phone-sales-plummet-42-percent-in-q4-2020-its-now-in-sixth-place/">sanctioned</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/how-huawei-made-a-cutting-edge-chip-in-china-and-surprised-the-us/">attempted to stymie Huawei's chip tech</a>.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Imagine you're a Japanese eel, swimming around just minding your own business when—bam! A predatory fish swallows you whole and you only have a few minutes to make your escape before certain death. What's an eel to do? According to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)00926-6">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, Japanese eels opt to back their way out of the digestive tract, tail first, through the esophagus, emerging from the predatory fish's gills.</p>
<p>Per the authors, this is the first such study to observe the behavioral patterns and escape processes of prey within the digestive tract of predators. “At this point, the Japanese eel is the only species of fish confirmed to be able to escape from the digestive tract of the predatory fish after being captured,” co-author Yuha Hasegawa at Nagasaki University in Japan <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2447128-watch-eels-escape-from-the-stomachs-of-fish-after-being-swallowed/?utm_campaign=RSS%7CNSNS&amp;utm_source=NSNS&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_content=news">told New Scientist</a>.</p>
<p>There are various strategies in nature for escaping predators after being swallowed. For instance, a parasitic worm called <em>Paragordius tricuspidatus</em> can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/440756a#:~:text=If%20a%20worm%20did%20not,surviving%20predation%20in%20this%20way.">force its way out</a> of a predator’s system when its host organism is eaten. There was also a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220308423">fascinating study</a> in 2020 by Japanese scientists on the unusual survival strategy of the aquatic beetle <em>Regimbartia attenuata</em>. They fed a bunch of the beetles to a pond frog (<em>Pelophylax nigromaculatus</em>) under laboratory conditions, expecting the frog to spit the beetle out. That's what happened with <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2017.0647">prior experiments</a> on bombardier beetles (<em>Pheropsophus jessoensis</em>), which spray toxic chemicals (described as an audible "chemical explosion") when they find themselves inside a toad's gut, inducing the toad to invert its own stomach and vomit them back out.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048599#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048599&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/review-mnt-reform-laptop-has-fully-open-hardware-and-software-for-better-or-worse/">original MNT Reform laptop</a> was an interesting experiment, an earnest stab at the idea of a laptop that used entirely open source, moddable hardware as well as open source software. But as a modern Internet-connected laptop, its chunky design and (especially) its super-slow processor let it down.</p>

<p>MNT Research has been upgrading the Reform laptop and its smaller counterpart, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/all-open-source-7-inch-mnt-reform-laptop-starts-at-899-ships-in-october/">Pocket Reform</a>, continuously since we took a look at it two-and-a-half years ago. The most significant upgrade is probably <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform-rcore-rk3588-processor-module">the Rockchip RK3588 processor upgrade</a>, which offers four ARM Cortex-A76 CPU cores (the same ones used in the Raspberry Pi 5's Broadcom SoC) and four ARM Cortex-A55 cores, plus either 16GB or 32GB of RAM. While still not a high-end speed demon, these specs are enough to make it a competent workhorse laptop for browsing and productivity apps.</p>
<p>Now, MNT is revisiting the Reform with a more significant design update. The <a href="https://mntre.com/media/reform_md/2024-09-09-introducing-mnt-reform-next.html">MNT Reform Next</a> is smaller and thinner, defaults to a more traditional glass trackpad instead of a trackball, and is starting with the Rockchip RK3588 instead of the poky NXP/Freescale processor that the original laptop was saddled with.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048810#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048810&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony today announced the PlayStation 5 Pro, a mid-generation hardware upgrade that will play the same game library as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">2020's PlayStation 5</a>, but with higher frame rates and better resolution than on the original system. The new units will be available on November 7 for $700, Sony said.</p>
<p>The updated hardware will come complete with 2TB of solid-state storage (up from 1TB on the original PS5), but without an Ultra HD Blu-Ray disc drive, which users <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/disc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles">can purchase as an add-on accessory for $80</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8">a video presentation Tuesday</a>, Sony's Mark Cerny said PS5 developers "desire more graphics performance" in order to deliver the visuals they want at a frame rate of 60 fps. The lack of enough graphical power on the PS5 leads to a difficult decision for players between the higher resolution of "fidelity" mode and the smoother frame rates of "performance" mode (with three-quarters of players choosing the latter, according to Cerny).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048663#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048663&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The company that compels you to industrialize an untouched alien planet in <em>Satisfactory, </em>FICSIT, is similar to <em>Portal</em>'s Aperture Science or <em>Fallout</em>'s Vault-Tec. You are a disposable employee, fed misinformation and pushed to ignore awful or incongruous things, all for the greater good of science, profit, or an efficient mixture of the two.</p>
<p>And yet even FICSIT was a bit concerned about how deep into the 1.0 release of <a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/"><em>Satisfactory</em></a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/satisfactory">Epic Games</a>, on sale until September 23) I had fallen. I got a warning that I had been playing for two hours straight. While FICSIT approved of hard work, it was important to have <em>some</em> work-life balance, it suggested.</p>
<p>Friends of mine had told me that they had to stop playing <em>Factorio</em> when it began to feel like an unpaid part-time job. Given a chance to check out <em>Satisfactory</em>, I presumed, like I always do, That Could Never Be Me. Folks, it was definitely me. I'm having a hard time writing this post, not because it's hard to describe or recommend <em>Satisfactory. </em>I just stayed up very late "reviewing" it, woke up thinking about it, and am wondering whether enough friends would want to join me that I should set up a private server.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048711#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048711&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, Microsoft made a series of announcements related to its Azure Quantum Cloud service. Among them was a demonstration of logical operations using the largest number of error-corrected qubits yet.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/quantum-error-correction-used-to-actually-correct-errors/">Since April</a>, we've tripled the number of logical qubits here," said Microsoft Technical Fellow Krysta Svore. "So we are accelerating toward that hundred-logical-qubit capability." The company has also lined up a new partner in the form of Atom Computing, which uses neutral atoms to hold qubits and has already demonstrated hardware with over 1,000 hardware qubits.</p>
<p>Collectively, the announcements are the latest sign that quantum computing has emerged from its infancy and is rapidly progressing toward the development of systems that can reliably perform calculations that would be impractical or impossible to run on classical hardware. We talked with people at Microsoft and some of its hardware partners to get a sense of what's coming next to bring us closer to useful quantum computing.<!--adbreak--></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048754#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048754&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an age when you can get just about anything online, it's probably no surprise that you can <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/HPHT-Cubic-Press-Synthetic-Diamond-Making_1600318712802.html?spm=a2700.7724857.0.0.237f4032pTaqn6">buy a diamond-making machine</a> for $200,000 on Chinese eCommerce site Alibaba. If, like me, you haven't been paying attention to the diamond industry, it turns out that the availability of these machines reflects an ongoing trend toward democratizing diamond production—a process that began decades ago and continues to evolve.</p>

<p>The history of lab-grown diamonds dates back at least half a century. According to Harvard graduate student Javid Lakha, writing in a <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/lab-grown-diamonds/">comprehensive piece</a> on lab-grown diamonds published in Works in Progress last month, the first successful synthesis of diamonds in a laboratory setting occurred in the 1950s. Lakha recounts how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Hall">Howard Tracy Hall</a>, a chemist at General Electric, created the first lab-grown diamonds using a high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) process that mimicked the conditions under which diamonds form in nature.</p>
<p>Since then, diamond-making technology has advanced significantly. Today, there are two primary methods for creating lab-grown diamonds: the HPHT process and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Both types of machines are now <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/synthetic-diamond-making-machine.html">listed on Alibaba</a>, with prices starting at around <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/HPHT-Cubic-Press-Synthetic-Diamond-Making_1600318712802.html">$200,000</a>, as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41492001">pointed out</a> in a Hacker News comment by engineer John Nagle (who goes by "<a href="https://www.animats.com/classic/index.html">Animats</a>" on Hacker News). A CVD machine we found is more pricey, at <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/VOAINO-WD-2204-915MHz-2450MHz-synthetic_1601024732626.html">around $450,000</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048698#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048698&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has suffered a significant defeat after the EU’s top court ruled that the iPhone maker must pay 13 billion euros in back taxes, overturning an earlier decision in the Big Tech group’s favor.</p>
<p>The ruling relates to a 2016 case when the EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said that Ireland had given the company an illegal sweetheart deal, amounting to a tax rate of less than 1 percent.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice said on Tuesday in its final ruling that it “confirms the European Commission’s 2016 decision: Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid which Ireland is required to recover.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048715#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048715&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Howdy, Arsians! Last year, we partnered with IBM to host <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2023/10/are-you-near-houston-come-to-our-it-event-at-space-center-houston-on-november-1/">an in-person event in the Houston area</a> where we all gathered together, had some cocktails, and talked about resiliency and the future of IT. Location always matters for things like this, and so we hosted it at Space Center Houston and had our cocktails amidst cool space artifacts. In addition to learning a bunch of neat stuff, it was awesome to hang out with all the amazing folks who turned up at the event. Much fun was had!</p>
<p>This year, we're back partnering with IBM again and we're looking to repeat that success with not one, but <em>two</em> in-person gatherings—each featuring a series of panel discussions with experts and capping off with a happy hour for hanging out and mingling. Where last time we went central, this time we're going to the coasts—both east and west. Read on for details!</p>
<h2>September: San Jose, California</h2>
<p>Our first event will be in <a href="https://events.arstechnica.com/ibm_beyond-the-buzz-sanjose/home?ref=ArsEditApplicant">San Jose on September 18</a>, and it's titled "Beyond the Buzz: An Infrastructure Future with GenAI and What Comes Next." The idea will be to look at what generative AI means for the future of data management.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037812#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037812&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On a sunny morning in December, an 18-wheeler will pull into a truck depot in Palmer, Texas, just south of Dallas. The driver will step out of the cab and help transfer his trailer to a second rig outfitted with powerful sensors.</p>
<p>This second truck will head south on Interstate 45 toward Houston. It will move cautiously, mostly cruising in the right lane at 65 mph despite the 75 mph speed limit.</p>
<p>After three and a half hours, the truck will exit the freeway in Greenpoint, a neighborhood in the north of Houston. It will proceed to a second truck depot, where the trailer will again be transferred to a new rig. A different driver will get in and haul the cargo to its final destination a few miles away.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048055#p3">Read 64 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048055&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Falcon 9 rocket streaked into the black predawn sky above Florida on Tuesday, carrying four people on the most ambitious private human spaceflight to date.</p>
<p>The crew of the Polaris Dawn mission, led by a billionaire pilot named Jared Isaacman, were injected into an orbit intended to reach an apogee of 1,200 km and a perigee of 190 km. They plan to raise Crew Dragon's orbit to an apogee of 1,400 km near the end of the first day of flight.</p>
<p>Shortly after the mission's launch, Isaacman thanked the flight controllers, engineers, and technicians at SpaceX that made the privately funded trip possible. "We wouldn't be on this journey without all 14,000 of you back at SpaceX," he said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048679#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048679&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For a while earlier this summer, it looked like NASA's flagship mission to study Jupiter's icy moon Europa might miss its launch window this year.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/07/nasas-flagship-mission-to-europa-has-a-problem-vulnerability-to-radiation/">engineers raised concerns</a> that transistors installed throughout the spacecraft might be susceptible to damage from radiation, an omnipresent threat for any probe whipping its way around Jupiter. The transistors are embedded in the spacecraft's circuitry and are responsible for approximately 200 unique applications, many of which are critical to keeping the mission operating as it orbits Jupiter and repeatedly zooms by Europa, interrogating the frozen moon with nine science instruments.</p>
<p>The transistors on the Europa Clipper spacecraft are already installed, and removing them for inspections or replacement would delay the mission's launch until late next year. Europa Clipper has a 21-day launch window beginning October 10 to begin its journey into the outer solar system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048668#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048668&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On Friday, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier">announced</a> plans to introduce an open source generative AI tool that will allow game creators to build 3D environments and objects using text prompts, reports <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/06/1103707/roblox-is-launching-a-generative-ai-that-builds-3d-environments-in-a-snap/">MIT Tech Review</a>. The feature, which is still under development, may streamline the process of creating game worlds on the popular online platform, potentially opening up more aspects of game creation to those without extensive 3D design skills.</p>

<p>Roblox has not announced a specific launch date for the new AI tool, which is based on what it calls a "3D foundational model." The company shared a demo video of the tool where a user types, "create a race track," then "make the scenery a desert," and the AI model creates a corresponding model in the proper environment.</p>
<p>The system will also reportedly let users make modifications, such as changing the time of day or swapping out entire landscapes, and Roblox says the multimodal AI model will ultimately accept video and 3D prompts, not just text.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048533#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048533&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, the US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google started in Virginia—this time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/googles-ad-tech-dominance-spurs-more-antitrust-charges-report-says/">challenging the tech giant's ad tech dominance</a>.</p>

During her opening statement, DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told US District Judge Leonie Brinkema—who will be ruling on the case after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/google-sends-doj-unexpected-check-in-attempt-to-avoid-monopoly-jury-trial/">Google cut a check to avoid a jury trial</a>—that "it’s worth saying the quiet part out loud," AP News<a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-ad-tech-virginia-opening-7a19f525287f782609a5316b1fdb08f0"> reported</a>.</p>

<p>Gun-owning parents who teach their kids how to responsibly handle and shoot a gun are less likely to store those deadly weapons safely, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2823159?guestAccessKey=7930a951-ea18-47e1-a2c7-036ddf5cf7e4">a survey-based study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics</a>.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by gun violence researchers at Rutgers University, analyzed survey responses from 870 gun-owning parents. Of those, the parents who responded that they demonstrated proper handling to their child or teen, had their kid practice safe handling under supervision, and/or taught their kid how to shoot a firearm were more likely than other gun-owning parents to keep at least one gun unsecured—that is, unlocked and loaded. In fact, each of the three responses carried at least double the odds of the parent having an unlocked, loaded gun around, the study found.</p>
<p>The survey responses may seem like a paradox for parents who value safe and responsible gun handling. Previous studies have suggested that safe storage of firearms can <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2733158">reduce the risk of injuries and deaths among children and teens</a>. A 2005 JAMA study, for instance, found <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200330">lower risks of firearm injuries among children and teens</a> when parents securely store their firearms—meaning they kept them locked, unloaded, and stored separately from locked ammunition. And as of 2020, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2201761">firearm-related injuries became the leading cause of death among children and teens</a> in the US.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048347#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048347&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
