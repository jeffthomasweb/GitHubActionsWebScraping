                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2019, <a href="https://recordstoreday.com/">Record Store Day</a> partnered with manufacturer Crosley to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/the-possible-curious-comeback-of-3-inch-vinyl-records/">revive a 3-inch collectible vinyl format</a> first launched in Japan in 2004. Five years later, a new 4-inch-sized format called <a href="https://www.tinyvinyl.com">Tiny Vinyl</a> wants to take the miniature vinyl collectible crown, and launch partner Target is throwing its considerable weight behind it as <a href="https://www.target.com/c/tiny-vinyl-records-music-movies-books/-/N-7f0kq">an exclusive launch partner</a>, with 44 titles expected in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>It’s 2025, and the global vinyl record market has reached $2 billion in annual sales and is <a href="https://www.imarcgroup.com/vinyl-record-market-statistics">still growing</a> at roughly 7 percent annually, according to market research firm Imarc. Vinyl record sales now account for over 50 percent of physical media sales for music (and this is despite a recent resurgence in both cassette and CD sales among Millennials). It's in this landscape that Tiny Vinyl founders Neil Kohler and Jesse Mann decided to come up with a fun new collectible vinyl format.</p>
<h2 id="an-aha-moment">An “aha” moment</h2>
<p>Kohler’s day job is working with toy companies to develop and market their ideas. He was involved in helping Funko popularize its stylized vinyl figurines, now a ubiquitous presence at pop culture conventions, comic book stores, and toy shops of all kinds. Mann has worked in production, marketing, and the music business for nearly three decades, including a stint at LiveNation and years of running operations for the annual summer music festival Bonnaroo. Both men are based in Nashville—Music City, USA—and the proximity to one of the main centers of the music industry clearly had an impact.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/tiny-vinyl-is-a-new-pocketable-record-format-for-the-spotify-age/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Today, Porsche debuted a new 911 variant at the IAA Mobility show in Munich, Germany. It's the most powerful 911 to date, excluding some limited-run models, and may well be the quickest to 60 mph from a standing start, dispatching that dash in just 2.4 seconds. And it's all thanks to one of the most interesting hybrid powertrains on sale today.</p>
<p>Rather than just bolting an electric motor to an existing 911, Porsche designed an entirely new 3.6 L flat-six engine, taking the opportunity to ditch the belt drive and move some of the ancillaries, which can instead be powered by the car's 400 V traction battery.</p>
<p>The system debuted in the 911 GTS T-Hybrid, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/porsches-best-daily-driver-911-the-2025-carrera-gts-t-hybrid-review/">which Ars recently reviewed</a>. For that car, Porsche added a single electric turbocharger, which works like the MGU-H in a Formula 1 car. It spins up almost instantly to 120,000 rpm to eliminate throttle lag, but also recaptures excess energy from the spinning turbine and sends that to the 1.9 kWh battery pack.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/porsches-insanely-clever-hybrid-engine-comes-to-the-911-turbo-s/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It was in 2002, during the George W. Bush administration, when NASA decided to put a satellite into orbit to track emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas pumped into the atmosphere through human activity.</p>
<p>After many twists and turns, NASA's 23-year remit of charting greenhouse gas emissions could come to a close as soon as the end of this month. President Donald Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/trump-administration-moves-to-tighten-the-noose-around-nasa-science-missions/">budget request to Congress</a> calls for terminating 41 of NASA's 124 science missions in development or operations, and another 17 would see their funding zeroed out in the near future. Overall, the proposed budget slashes NASA's spending by 25 percent and cuts NASA's science funding in half.</p>
<p>This year's federal budget runs out September 30, and although lawmakers from both parties have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/congress-moves-to-reject-bulk-of-white-houses-proposed-nasa-cuts/">signaled they will reject most of Trump's cuts</a>, it's far from certain that Congress will pass a budget for the next fiscal year before the looming deadline. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has directed NASA managers to make plans to close out the missions tagged for cancellation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/gop-may-finally-succeed-in-unrelenting-quest-to-kill-two-nasa-climate-satellites/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As fall approaches and COVID cases tick up, you might be thinking about getting this season's COVID-19 vaccine. The annually updated shots have previously been easily accessible to anyone over 6 months of age. Most people could get them at no cost by simply walking into their neighborhood pharmacy—and that's what most people did.</p>
<p>However, the situation is much different this year with an ardent anti-vaccine activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the country's top health official. Since taking the role, Kennedy has worked diligently to dismantle the country's premier vaccination infrastructure, as well as directly hinder access to lifesaving shots. That includes restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines—something he's done by brazenly flouting all standard federal processes while providing no evidence-based reasoning for the changes.</p>
<h2>How we got here</h2>
<p>In late May, Kennedy unilaterally decided that all healthy children and pregnant people should <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-axes-covid-shot-guidance-for-pregnant-people-kids/">no longer have access to the shots</a>. He announced the unprecedented change not through official federal channels, but via a video posted on Elon Musk's X platform. Top vaccine and infectious disease officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—which sets federal vaccination recommendations—said they also learned of the change via X.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/who-can-get-a-covid-vaccine-and-how-its-complicated/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Authors revealed today that Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion and destroy all copies of the books the AI company pirated to train its artificial intelligence models.</p>
<p>In a press release provided to Ars, the authors confirmed that the settlement is "believed to be the largest publicly reported recovery in the history of US copyright litigation." Covering 500,000 works that Anthropic pirated for AI training, if a court approves the settlement, each author will receive $3,000 per work that Anthropic stole. "Depending on the number of claims submitted, the final figure per work could be higher," the press release noted.</p>
<p>Anthropic has already agreed to the settlement terms, but a court must approve them before the settlement is finalized. Preliminary approval may be granted this week, while the ultimate decision may be delayed until 2026, the press release noted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/first-of-its-kind-ai-settlement-anthropic-to-pay-authors-1-5-billion/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's next product event is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/08/apples-next-iphone-event-is-happening-september-9-at-1-pm-eastern/">happening on September 9</a>, and while the company hasn't <em>technically</em> dropped any hints about what's coming, anyone with a working memory and a sense of object permanence can tell you that an Apple event in the month of September means next-generation iPhones.</p>
<p>Apple's flagship phones have changed in mostly subtle ways since 2022's iPhone 14 Pro added the Dynamic Island and 2023's refreshes switched from Lightning to USB-C. Chips get gradually faster, cameras get gradually better, but Apple hasn't done a seismic iPhone X-style rethinking of its phones since, well, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/iphone-x-review-early-adopting-the-future/">2017's iPhone X</a>.</p>
<p>The rumor mill thinks that Apple is working on a foldable iPhone—and such a device would certainly benefit from years of investment in the iPad—but if it's coming, it probably won't be this year. That doesn't mean Apple is totally done iterating on the iPhone X-style design, though. Let's run down what the most reliable rumors have said we're getting.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/what-to-expect-and-not-expect-from-yet-another-september-apple-event/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Firaxis Games, the studio that developed <em>Civilization VII</em>, is undergoing layoffs. The news went public when a former employee took to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369382797020463105/">LinkedIn</a> to announce her unemployment; Game Developer <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis">picked the story up</a>, and publisher 2K Games soon confirmed it.</p>
<p>"We can confirm there was a staff reduction today at Firaxis Games, as the studio restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity," a spokesperson wrote to multiple news outlets. The company did not confirm the number of people laid off.</p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google may have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-rules/">escaped the most serious consequences</a> in its most recent antitrust fight with the US Department of Justice (DOJ), but the European Union is still gunning for the search giant. After a brief delay, the European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1992">announced</a> a substantial 2.95 billion euro ($3.45 billion) fine relating to Google's anti-competitive advertising practices. This is not Google's first big fine in the EU, and it probably won't be the last, but it's the first time European leaders could face blowback from the US government for going after Big Tech.</p>
<p>The case stems from a complaint made by the European Publishers Council in 2021. The ensuing EU investigation determined that Google illegally preferenced its own ad display services, which made its Google Ad Exchange (AdX) marketplace more important in the European ad space. As a result, the competition says Google was able to charge higher fees for its service, standing in the way of fair competition since at least 2014.</p>
<p>A $3.45 billion fine would be a staggering amount for most firms, but Google's earnings have never been higher. In Q2 2025, Google had net earnings of over $28 billion on almost $100 billion in revenue. The European Commission isn't stopping with financial penalties, though. Google has also been ordered to end its anti-competitive advertising practices and submit a plan for doing so within 60 days.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/europe-slaps-google-with-2-95b-euro-fine-over-advertising-monopoly/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Lenovo has proven again that it isn’t content with PC designs. The latest era of laptops has been focused on ultralight computers that are easy to transport, but they're hard to differentiate. However, Lenovo’s continual experimentation has brought us some unique laptop releases and concepts in recent years, including a laptop with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/lenovo-laptop-has-a-screen-that-expands-from-14-to-16-7-inches-for-3500/">screen that expands by rolling</a>, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/the-most-intriguing-tech-gadget-prototypes-demoed-this-week/">laptop with an outward folding screen</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/hands-on-lenovos-second-foldable-pc-addresses-the-firsts-biggest-problems/">laptops with foldable screens</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/a-threat-to-portable-monitors-everywhere-lenovo-yoga-book-9i-review/">laptops with dual 14-inch displays</a>.</p>
<p>The ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept laptop shown off today at the IFA conference in Berlin continues this exploration with a screen that you can swivel into and out of portrait mode.</p>
<h2>Concept laptop</h2>
<p>The VertiFlex PC demoed is a prototype. Lenovo doesn't have any plans to release the laptop and hasn't provided further details, like the components used in the prototype. That said, Lenovo has previously turned concepts into real products, such as the <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkbook/thinkbook-plus/thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-14-16-inch-intel/len101b0056">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable.</a></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/lenovo-demos-laptop-with-a-screen-you-can-swivel-into-portrait-mode/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Warner Bros. hit Midjourney with a lawsuit Thursday, crafting a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Warner-Bros-v-Midjourney-Complaint-9-4-25.pdf">complaint</a> that strives to shoot down defenses that the AI company has already raised in a similar lawsuit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/in-landmark-suit-disney-and-universal-sue-midjourney-for-ai-character-theft/">filed by Disney and Universal Studios</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>The big film studios have alleged that Midjourney profits off image generation models trained to produce outputs of popular characters. For Disney and Universal, intellectual property rights to pop icons like Darth Vader and the Simpsons were allegedly infringed. And now, the WB complaint defends rights over comic characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman, as well as characters considered "pillars of pop culture with a lasting impact on generations," like Scooby-Doo and Bugs Bunny, and modern cartoon characters like Rick and Morty.</p>
<p>"Midjourney brazenly dispenses Warner Bros. Discovery’s intellectual property as if it were its own," the WB complaint said, accusing Midjourney of allowing subscribers to "pick iconic" copyrighted characters and generate them in "every imaginable scene."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/warner-bros-sues-midjourney-to-stop-ai-knockoffs-of-batman-scooby-doo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA's interim administrator, Sean Duffy, said Thursday he has heard the recent talk about how some people are starting to believe that China will land humans on the Moon before NASA can return there with the Artemis Program.</p>
<p>"We had testimony that said NASA will not beat China to the Moon," Duffy remarked during an all-hands meeting with NASA employees. "That was shade thrown on all of NASA. I heard it, and I gotta tell you what, maybe I am competitive, I was angry about it. I can tell you what, I'll be damned if that is the story that we write. We are going to beat the Chinese to the Moon."</p>
<p>Duffy's remarks followed a Congressional hearing on Wednesday during which former Congressman Jim Bridenstine, who served as NASA administrator during President Trump's first term, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/ted-cruz-criticizes-trump-plan-to-cancel-sls-and-lunar-gateway-as-folly/">said China had pulled ahead of NASA</a> and the United States in the second space race.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/nasas-acting-chief-angry-about-talk-that-china-will-beat-us-back-to-the-moon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1963697012014215181">announced</a> that ChatGPT users can now branch conversations into multiple parallel threads, serving as a useful reminder that AI chatbots <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-personhood-trap-how-ai-fakes-human-personality/">aren't people with fixed viewpoints</a> but rather malleable tools you can rewind and redirect. The company <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">released</a> the feature for all logged-in web users following years of user requests for the capability.</p>
<p>The feature works by letting users hover over any message in a ChatGPT conversation, click "More actions," and select "Branch in new chat." This creates a new conversation thread that includes all the conversation history up to that specific point, while preserving the original conversation intact.</p>
<p>Think of it almost like creating a new copy of a "document" to edit while keeping the original version safe—except that "document" is an ongoing AI conversation with all its accumulated context. For example, a marketing team brainstorming ad copy can now create separate branches to test a formal tone, a humorous approach, or an entirely different strategy—all stemming from the same initial setup.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/chatgpts-new-branching-feature-is-a-good-reminder-that-ai-chatbots-arent-people/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo's data-free, download-unlocking Game Key Cards <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">have proven popular with game publishers</a>, even as they've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">drawn ire</a> from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/when-will-switch-2s-data-free-game-key-cards-become-useless-e-waste/">many fans</a> of games stored on physical media. Now, though, a developer on <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is saying that a technical limitation of the Switch 2's Game Card interface may be driving some publishers away from fully physical game releases on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Writing in a Bluesky thread discussing the performance of the <em>Outlaws'</em> Switch 2 port [which is only available as a download or Game Key Card], Snowdrop Audio Architect Rob Bantin <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l45oa4c3p2ndptazexy33q3z/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e">chimed in</a> to discuss why a full physical release wasn't in the cards for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>"Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments, and we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for," Bantin wrote. "I think if we’d designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different. As it was, we’d build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case, I think our leadership made the right call."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/dev-says-switch-2s-physical-game-cards-were-too-slow-for-star-wars-outlaws-port/">Read full article</a></p>

In Washington, DC, Congress has pushed back on the Trump administration's plan to stop flying the Space Launch System rocket after Artemis III. Congress made it clear that it wants to keep the booster in business for a long time. The big question now is whether the Trump White House will blink.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">BMW provided flights from Washington, DC, to Munich and accommodation so Ars could be briefed on the iX3. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>BMW has an all-electric replacement for its X3 crossover on the way. When it arrives in mid-2026, it will have the lowest carbon footprint of any BMW yet, thanks to an obsessive approach to sustainability during the design process. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/how-bmw-slashed-the-carbon-footprint-of-its-next-ev-the-2026-ix3/">we knew that already</a>; what we couldn't tell you then, but can now, is everything else we know about the first of the so-called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/bmws-neue-klasse-points-to-a-radical-reinvention-for-future-sedans/">Neue Klasse</a> electric vehicles.</p>
<p>"The Neue Klasse is our biggest future-focused project and marks a huge leap forward in terms of technologies, driving experience, and design," said BMW chairman Oliver Zipse. "Practically everything about it is new, yet it is also more BMW than ever. Our whole product range will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue Klasse—whichever drive system technology is employed. What started as a bold vision has now become reality: the BMW iX3 is the first Neue Klasse model to go into series production, kicking off a new era for BMW."</p>
<h2>A new face</h2>
<p>The iX3 also debuts a new corporate face for BMW's SUVs: From now on, these will have tall, narrow kidney grilles like the one you see here, as opposed to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/bmws-neue-klasse-points-to-a-radical-reinvention-for-future-sedans/">short, wide grille seen on the front of the Neue Klasse sedan</a> (which is almost certainly the next 3 Series). LEDs replace chrome, and there's a new take on BMW's usual four headlights, although the illuminated kidney grill is an option, not mandatory. Despite the two-box shape, the iX3 manages a drag coefficient of just 0.24.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/neue-klasse-bmws-tech-filled-ix3-electric-suv-is-unveiled/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>US health secretary and ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. went before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday amid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/cdc-spiraled-into-chaos-this-week-heres-where-things-stand/">turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and widespread chaos over access to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>In the combative three-hour hearing, Kennedy defended his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/report-cdc-director-being-ousted-just-weeks-after-senate-confirmation/">dramatic firing of the CDC director last week</a>, less than a month after her confirmation, which he effusively supported. Today, he repeatedly called her a liar and made the extraordinary claim that she openly confessed to him that she cannot be trusted. Kennedy went on to reiterate the dangerous claim that the CDC is corrupt. That's despite calls from agency staff for Kennedy to tone down such rhetoric after a gunman—who was influenced by vaccine misinformation and the vilification of the public health agency—sprayed the CDC campus with over 500 rounds and killed a local police officer last month.</p>
<p>Regarding vaccines, particularly COVID-19 vaccines, Kennedy made his usual anti-vaccine talking points. He gave the tired refrain that all the medical, pediatrics, infectious disease, and public health experts who disagree with his views and support existing vaccines do so simply because they have been bought off by the pharmaceutical industry. He repeatedly falsely claimed that his actions as secretary have not restricted access to COVID-19 vaccines, despite the fact that he directly restricted access to COVID-19 vaccines. People, including cancer patients, are currently being denied access to the vaccines in multiple states due to the restrictions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/a-charlatan-chaos-and-lies-anti-vaccine-activist-rfk-jr-faces-senate/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Wednesday’s discovery of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/mis-issued-certificates-for-1-1-1-1-dns-service-pose-a-threat-to-the-internet/">three mis-issued TLS certificates</a> for Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 encrypted DNS lookup service generated intense interest and concern among Internet security practitioners. The revelation raised the possibility that an unknown entity had obtained the cryptographic equivalent of a skeleton key that could be used to surreptitiously decrypt millions of users’ DNS queries that were encrypted through DNS over TLS or DNS over HTTPS. From there, the scammers could have read queries or even tampered with results to send 1.1.1.1 users to malicious sites.</p>
<p>Since then, new information and analysis have become available, including the issuance of nine additional certificates since February 2024. This FAQ list is designed to answer questions raised in comments to the story and to provide the latest on what’s known about the incident, which Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unauthorized-issuance-of-certificates-for-1-1-1-1/">said Thursday</a> constituted an “unacceptable lapse in security by Fina CA," the Microsoft-trusted certificate authority (CA) responsible for all 12 of the mis-issued certificates.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sextortion-based hacking, which hijacks a victim's webcam or blackmails them with nudes they're tricked or coerced into sharing, has long represented one of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jeff-bezos-sextortion-allegation/">the most disturbing forms of cybercrime</a>. Now one specimen of widely available spyware has turned that relatively manual crime into an automated feature, detecting when the user is browsing pornography on their PC, screenshotting it, and taking a candid photo of the victim through their webcam.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, researchers at security firm Proofpoint published their <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/not-safe-work-tracking-and-investigating-stealerium-and-phantom-infostealers">analysis</a>of an open-source variant of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/infostealer-malware-password-theft/">“infostealer” malware</a> known as Stealerium that the company has seen used in multiple cybercriminal campaigns since May of this year. The malware, like all infostealers, is designed to infect a target's computer and automatically send a hacker a wide variety of stolen sensitive data, including banking information, usernames and passwords, and keys to victims' crypto wallets. Stealerium, however, adds another, more humiliating form of espionage: It also monitors the victim's browser for web addresses that include certain NSFW keywords, screenshots browser tabs that include those words, photographs the victim via their webcam while they're watching those porn pages, and sends all the images to a hacker—who can then blackmail the victim with the threat of releasing them.</p>
<p>“When it comes to infostealers, they typically are looking for whatever they can grab,” says Selena Larson, one of the Proofpoint researchers who worked on the company's analysis. “This adds another layer of privacy invasion and sensitive information that you definitely wouldn't want in the hands of a particular hacker.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/sextortion-with-a-twist-spyware-takes-webcam-pics-of-users-watching-porn/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The start of the COVID-19 pandemic is now five years in the rearview mirror, but its effects continue to reverberate. While those leading the US healthcare system have embraced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/maha-draft-takes-on-electromagnetic-radiation-echoing-rfk-jr-s-conspiracies/">conspiracy theories</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-s-cdc-panel-ditches-some-flu-shots-based-on-anti-vaccine-junk-data/">junk science</a> to justify a reduced focus on vaccines (particularly the COVID jab) many people are still seeking out immunization. Google Maps isn't a good way to find it, though. In recent days, almost all search results for COVID vaccines have vanished from Google Maps.</p>
<p>In both the mobile app and website, Google Maps returns zero results for terms like "COVID vaccine" and simply "vaccines." We've tested and confirmed this in multiple US regions, as well as internationally. In some places, these searches will return no local results but may include links to facilities hundreds of miles away. Meanwhile, searches for less-contentious injections like "flu vaccine" and "shingles vaccine" continue to get local results. Bing Maps, Apple Maps, and other Google alternatives have no issue showing COVID vaccine providers.</p>
<p>The <span class="vpl77" data-hveid="CHsQAA">Food and Drug Administration</span> under Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently approved the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/under-anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-fda-to-limit-access-to-covid-19-shots/">updated COVID shot</a>, but the agency only recommends it for those with underlying health conditions and people over age 65. That makes boosters harder for many Americans to get—and the first step is often finding a nearby provider of immunization. For at least the last week, Google Maps has returned no results for those vaccine-related queries.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/covid-vaccine-locations-vanish-from-google-maps-due-to-alleged-technical-issue/">Read full article</a></p>
