              <![CDATA[<p>A brave YouTuber has managed to defeat a fake Nintendo lawyer improperly targeting his channel with copyright takedowns that could have seen his entire channel removed if YouTube issued one more strike.</p>
<p>Sharing his story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/27/24326278/nintendo-fake-takedowns-youtube-domtendo-dmca">with The Verge</a>, Dominik "Domtendo" Neumayer—a German YouTuber who has broadcasted play-throughs of popular games for 17 years—said that it all started when YouTube removed some videos from his channel that were centered on <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>. Those removals came after a pair of complaints were filed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and generated two strikes. Everyone on YouTube knows that three strikes mean you're out and off the platform permanently.</p>
<p>Suddenly at risk of losing the entire channel he had built on YouTube, Neumayer was stunned, The Verge noted, partly because most game companies consider "Let's Play" videos like his to be free marketing, not a threat to their business. And while Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/nintendo-issues-copyright-claims-on-mario-themed-minecraft-videos/">been known to target YouTubers</a> with DMCA takedowns, it generally historically took no issues with accounts like his.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/youtuber-won-dmca-fight-with-fake-nintendo-lawyer-by-detecting-spoofed-email/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>'Tis the season for many holiday traditions, including the Ugly Christmas Sweater—you know, those 1950s-style heavy knits featuring some kind of cartoonish seasonal decoration, like snowflakes, Santa Claus, or—in the case of Mark Darcy from <em>Bridget Jones' Diary</em> (2001)—Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. "It’s obnoxious and tacky, but also fuzzy and kind of wholesome—the fashion equivalent of a Hallmark Christmas movie (with a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek)," as CNN's Marianna Cerini <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/ugly-christmas-sweater-holidays-history/index.html">recently observed</a>.</p>
<p>Fashion (or lack thereof) aside, sweaters and other knitted fabric are also fascinating to physicists and mathematicians. Case in point: a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.248201">recent paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Letters examining the complex mechanics behind the many resting shapes a good Jersey knit can form while at rest.</p>
<p>Knitted fabrics are part of a class of intertwined materials—which also includes birds' nests, surgical knots, knotted shoelaces, and even the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10570-023-05683-x">degradation of paper fibers</a> in ancient manuscripts. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/physicists-are-decoding-math-y-secrets-of-knitting-to-make-bespoke-materials/">Knitted fabrics are technically a type</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial">metamaterial</a>: an engineered material that gets its properties not from the base materials but from their designed structures. The elasticity (aka, stretchiness) of knitted fabrics is an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3410/03-ask.html">emergent property</a>: the whole is more than the sum of its parts. How those components (strands of yarn) are arranged at an intermediate scale (the structure) determines the macro scale properties of the resulting fabric.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/the-physics-of-ugly-christmas-sweaters/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has finally shared details about its plans to shake up its core business by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openai-plans-tectonic-shift-from-nonprofit-to-for-profit-giving-altman-equity/">shifting to a for-profit </a>corporate structure.</p>
<p>On Thursday, OpenAI posted on its <a href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">blog</a>, confirming that in 2025, the existing for-profit arm will be transformed into a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC). As a PBC, OpenAI would be required to balance its shareholders' and stakeholders' interests with the public benefit. To achieve that, OpenAI would offer "ordinary shares of stock" while using some profits to further its mission—"ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity"—to serve a social good.</p>
<p>To compensate for losing control over the for-profit, the nonprofit would have some shares in the PBC, but it's currently unclear how many will be allotted. Independent financial advisors will help OpenAI reach a "fair valuation," the blog said, while promising the new structure would "multiply" the donations that previously supported the nonprofit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/openai-defends-for-profit-shift-as-critical-to-sustain-humanitarian-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apparently Hertz's purging of electric vehicles from its fleet isn't going fast enough for the car rental giant. A Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HertzRentals/comments/1hi5p7d/hertz_trying_to_sell_you_the_car_youre_currently/">posted an offer</a> they received from Hertz to buy the 2023 Tesla Model 3 they had been renting for $17,913.</p>
<p>Hertz originally went strong into EVs, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/hertz-to-purchase-100000-tesla-model-3s-for-its-rental-fleet/">announcing a plan</a> to buy 100,000 Model 3s for its fleet by the end of 2021, but 16 months later had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/hertz-falls-short-of-ambitious-tesla-2022-fleet-goal/">acquired only half that amount</a>. The company found that repair costs—especially for Teslas, which averaged 20 percent more than other EVs—were cutting into its profit margins. Customer demand was also not what Hertz had hoped for; last January, it announced plans to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/hertz-is-selling-20000-used-evs-due-to-high-repair-costs/">sell off 20,000 EVs</a>.</p>
<p>Asking its customers if they want to purchase their rentals isn't a new strategy for Hertz. "By connecting our rental customers who opt into our emails to our sales channels, we're not only building awareness of the fact that we sell arsenal but also offering a unique opportunity to someone who may be in the market for the same car they have on rent," Hertz communications director Jamie Line <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/26/24329874/hertz-ev-tesla-email-sales-offers">told The Verge</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/hertz-is-asking-ev-renters-if-they-want-to-buy-their-rentals/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There are thousands of YouTube videos in which DIY science enthusiasts cut grapes in half—leaving just a thin bit of skin connecting them—and put the grapes in the microwave, just to marvel at the sparks and plume of ionized gas (plasma) that the grapes produce. This quirky property of grapes might help make more efficient quantum sensors, according to a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.22.064078">new paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Applied.</p>
<p>The plasma-inducing grape effect was first observed in 1994, per the authors. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/these-scientists-broke-12-microwaves-to-learn-how-grapes-create-plasmas/">previously reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-here-s-how-to-make-plasma-by-microwaving-a-grape">usual explanation</a> for the generation of plasmas is that grapes are so small that the irradiating microwaves become <a href="https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=818">highly concentrated</a> in the grape tissue, <a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/12/3/7326643/grape-plasma-microwave">ripping some the molecules apart</a> to generate charged ions (adding to the electrolytes already present in the grapes). The electromagnetic field that forms causes ions to flow from one grape half to the other via the connecting skin—at least at first. That's when you get the initial sparks. Eventually, the ions start passing through the surrounding air as well, ionizing it to produce that hot plume of plasma.</p>
<p>But in 2019, Trent University scientists <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1818350116">showed that</a> explanation isn't quite right. The skin bridge isn't necessary for the effect to occur. Rather, the plasma is generated by an electromagnetic "hot spot." The grapes have the right refractive index and size to "trap" microwaves, so putting two of them close together leads to the generation of a hot spot between them. The trick also works with gooseberries, large blackberries, and quail eggs, as well as hydrogel beads—plastic beads soaked in water. ("Many microwaves were in fact harmed during the experiments," co-author Hamza Khattak admitted at the time.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/could-microwaved-grapes-be-used-for-quantum-sensing/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>One key area of interest is how the world’s largest software provider packages popular Office products together with cybersecurity and cloud computing services, said one of the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.</p>
<p>This so-called bundling was the subject of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-white-house-offer-cybersecurity-biden-nadella">a recent ProPublica investigation</a>, which detailed how, beginning in 2021, Microsoft used the practice to vastly expand its business with the US government while boxing competitors out of lucrative federal contracts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/ftc-launches-probe-of-microsoft-over-bundling/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When you want to move an object from one place to another, you usually grab it with your hands or a robotic arm. But what if you want to move something you cannot touch without damaging or disrupting it, like a droplet of liquid? A solution proposed by a team of scientists at the North Carolina State University is a metamaterial that can change shape in response to magnetic fields.</p>
<p>This material had to be easily deformable to change shape, yet at the same time stiff enough to bear loads. “That seemed contradictory—how do you make something that is stiff and deformable at once?” says Jie Yin, a mechanical metamaterials researcher at NC State. His team did it with ferromagnetic elastomers, kirigami cuts, balloons, and magnets.</p>
<h2>Refreshable Braille display</h2>
<p>“There is not much research on using magnets to manipulate non-magnetic objects. It is very, very hard,” says Yinding Chi, another NC State researcher and lead author of the study. The idea Chi and his colleagues came up with could be compared to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/braille-display-demo-refreshes-with-miniature-fireballs/">refreshable Braille display</a>. They imagined a surface dotted with domes that could rise, turn, or depress on demand, allowing it to dynamically form relief-like images or move in a pattern similar to waves in the ocean. Objects would then move on these surfaces like they were carried by waves. “This way, you can move various objects without using grippers,” Yin says.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/magnetic-shape-shifting-surface-can-move-stuff-without-grasping-it/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There is now a genetic excuse not to bother cutting carbs. Humans have genetically adapted to eating starchy foods, and our ancestors may have been carb-ivores even before modern <i>Homo sapiens </i>emerged.</p>
<p>The salivary amylase gene, known as AMY1, is already known to have helped us adapt to eating carbs. It encodes amylase, an enzyme that breaks starches found in pasta and bread down to glucose—and may have given us a taste preference for them. Humans have multiple copies of the gene, which may help us produce high levels of the enzyme.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Buffalo and the Jackson Laboratory have now found that, while most copies of this gene arose with the advent of farming, modern humans and our closest relatives had accumulated extra copies long before agriculture.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/craving-carbs-blame-an-ancient-gene/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>More than 18,500 games will have been released onto the PC gaming platform Steam in the year 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">according to SteamDB</a>. Dividing that by the number of people covering games at Ars, or the gaming press at large, or even everybody who games and writes about it online, yields a brutal ratio.</p>
<p>Games often float down the river of time to us, filtered by friends, algorithms, or pure happenstance. They don't qualify for our best games of the year list, but they might be worth mentioning on their own. Many times, they're better games then they were at release, either by patching or just perspective. And they are almost always lower priced.</p>
<p>Inspired by the cruel logic of calendars and year-end lists, I asked my coworkers to tell me about their favorite games <em>of</em> 2024 that were not <em>from</em> 2024. What resulted were some quirky gems, some reconsiderations, and some titles that just happened to catch us at the right time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It started, like so many overwrought home optimization projects, during the pandemic.</p>
<p>My wife and I, like many people stuck inside, were ordering takeout more frequently. We wanted to support local restaurants, reduce the dish load, and live a little. It became clear early on that app-based delivery services like DoorDash and Uber Eats were not the best way to support local businesses. If a restaurant had its own ordering site or a preferred service, we wanted to use that—or even, heaven forfend, call the place.</p>
<p>The secondary issue was that we kept ordering from the same places, and we wanted to mix it up. Sometimes we'd want to pick something up nearby. Sometimes we wanted to avoid an entire category ("Too many carbs this week, no pasta") or try the newest places we knew about, or maybe a forgotten classic. Or just give me three places randomly, creative constraints, please—it's Friday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/making-tiny-no-code-webapps-out-of-spreadsheets-is-a-weirdly-fulfilling-hobby/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's been a wild year in tech thanks to the intersection between humans and artificial intelligence. 2024 brought a parade of AI oddities, mishaps, and wacky moments that inspired odd behavior from both machines and man. From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.</p>
<p>Why the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/chatgpts-success-could-have-come-sooner-says-former-google-ai-researcher/">Transformer-based</a> AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">launched in June</a> held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">OpenAI's o1</a> used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/">NotebookLM</a> also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">music synthesis models</a> and also better <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/">AI video generators</a>, including several from China.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their favorite film that serves as alternative Christmas movie fare, with <em>Die Hard</em> (1988) and <em>Lethal Weapon</em> (1987) typically topping the list—at least when all you want for Christmas is buddy-cop banter, car chases, shootouts, and glorious explosions. (Massive gratuitous property damage is a given.) I love me some <em>Lethal Weapon</em> but it's high time to give some holiday love to another great action flick set during the Christmas season: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Kiss_Goodnight"><em>The Long Kiss Goodnight</em></a> (1996), starring Geena Davis as an amnesiac school teacher who turns out to have been a government assassin in her former life.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below for this nearly 30-year-old film.)</strong></p>
<p>At the time, Davis was married to director Renny Harlin, coming off a disastrous showing for their previous collaboration, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroat_Island"><em>Cutthroat Island</em></a> (1995), which remains one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. (It is indeed a pretty bad movie.) But Shane Black's smart, savvy script for <em>The Long Kiss Goodnight</em> seemed like the perfect next project for them; it was promising enough that New Line Cinema bought it for what was then a record $4 million.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/why-the-long-kiss-goodnight-is-a-great-alt-christmas-movie/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor's note</strong>: Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything major, please note this list does include a few specific references to several of the listed shows that some might consider spoiler-y.</em></p>
<p>This was another good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Really, 2024 had a little of everything, from wacky crime capers (<em>Bad Monkey</em>) and Satanic Panic (<em>Hysteria</em>) to dystopian video game adaptations (<em>Fallout</em>) and sweeping historical epics (<em>Shōgun)</em>, with plenty of genre-mashup delights in between. While streaming platforms continue to dominate, the selection is more evenly distributed across them this year, with only Hulu and Netflix snagging more than two slots (depending on whether or not you lump Hulu together with Disney+ after the merger).</p>
<p>As always, we're opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our "year's best" vote at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/tv-technica-2024-our-picks-for-the-best-of-tv/">Read full article</a></p>

You still have time to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $4,000 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win).</p>
<p>In the first week or so of the drive, hundreds of readers have contributed well over $16,000 to either the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is barely hanging on to a small donation lead at the moment). That's a long way off from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/">2020's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Thursday, January 2, 2025.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/reminder-donate-to-win-swag-in-our-annual-charity-drive-sweepstakes-16/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At this point, any serious retro gamer knows that a bulky cathode ray tube (CRT) TV provides <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/10/11/are-crt-tvs-important-for-retro-gaming/">the most authentic</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/video-demonstrates-the-marvel-of-crt-displays-at-380000-frames-per-second/">lag-free experience</a> for game consoles that predate the era of flat-panel HDTVs (i.e,. before the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 era). But modern gamers used to massive flat panel HD displays might balk at the display size of the most common CRTs, which tend to average in the 20- to 30-inch range (depending on the era they were made).</p>
<p>For those who want the absolute largest CRT experience possible, Sony's KX-45ED1 model (aka PVM-4300) has become the stuff of legends. The massive 45-inch CRT was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/xuhbb9/biggest_trinitron_ever_the_kx45ed1_it_was_sold/">sold in the late '80s</a> for a whopping $40,000 (over $100,000 in today's dollars), according to contemporary reports.</p>
<p>That price means it wasn't exactly a mass-market product, and the limited supply has made it something of a white whale for CRT enthusiasts to this day. While a few pictures have emerged of the PVM-4300 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/liyitz/the_picture_of_kx45ed1_aka_pvm4300/">in the wild</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/444560212348840/posts/2936345963170240/">in marketing materials</a>, no collector has stepped forward with detailed footage of a working unit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/retro-gamers-save-one-of-the-last-45-inch-crt-tvs-in-existence/">Read full article</a></p>

Alternatively, you could buy just one mechanical keyboard kit. Costing the same as a desktop computer, The Icebreaker keyboard commands one of the highest price tags you'll see for a keyboard, and that's more due to its appearance than its capabilities.</p>
<p>The Icebreaker, spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/mechanical-keyboards/usd1-600-aluminum-icebreaker-keyboard-breaks-the-bank-sports-metal-chassis-keycaps-with-800-micro-perforations-and-via-support">Tom's Hardware</a>, became available for <a href="https://www.serene.industries/product/the-icebreaker-kit">preorder</a> on Thursday. The prohibitively priced peripheral is the primary product from Serene Industries, which founder Denis Agarkov <a href="https://www.serene.industries/home-main#updates">describes</a> as an “outlet for creativity, love of materials, experimentation, and an endless exercise in learning new things."</p>
<p>In a February interview with <a href="https://design-milk.com/serene-industries-carves-metal-into-the-icebreaker-keyboard/">Design Milk</a>, Agarkov said that the profile view of New York City’s Flatiron skyscraper inspired the keyboard’s design. The building opened in 1902 and measures 285 feet tall with a steel frame and distinct prism shape.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/2100-mechanical-keyboard-has-800-holes-nyc-skyscraper-looks/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Flu season is ramping up across the US, but Louisiana—the state that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/louisiana-bars-health-dept-from-promoting-flu-covid-mpox-vaccines-report/">reportedly barred its health department from promoting flu shots</a>, as well as COVID-19 and mpox vaccines—is leading the country with an early and strong surge.</p>
<p>Louisiana's flu activity has reached the "Very High" category set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2024-week-50.html"> the latest data</a>. The 13-category scale is based on the percentage of doctor's visits that were for influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in the previous week. Louisiana is at the first of three "Very High" levels.

              <![CDATA[<p>Health care company Ascension lost sensitive data for nearly 5.6 million individuals in a cyberattack that was attributed to a notorious ransomware gang, according to documents filed with the attorney general of Maine.</p>
<p>Ascension owns 140 hospitals and scores of assisted living facilities. In May, the organization was hit with an attack that caused <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/19/nx-s1-5010219/ascension-hospital-ransomware-attack-care-lapses">mass disruptions</a> as staff was <a href="https://about.ascension.org/cybersecurity-event">forced</a> to move to manual processes that caused errors, delayed or lost lab results, and diversions of ambulances to other hospitals. Ascension managed to restore most services by mid-June. At the time, the company said the attackers had stolen protected health information and personally identifiable information for an undisclosed number of people.</p>
<h2>Investigation concluded</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/e55264f2-ff87-4b28-874d-653cfb735fe6.html">filing</a> Ascension made earlier in December revealed that nearly 5.6 million people were affected by the breach. Data stolen depended on the particular person but included individuals' names and medical information (e.g., medical record numbers, dates of service, types of lab tests, or procedure codes), payment information (e.g., credit card information or bank account numbers), insurance information (e.g., Medicaid/Medicare ID, policy number, or insurance claim), government<br>
identification (e.g., Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver’s license numbers, or passport numbers), and other personal information (such as date of birth or address).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/health-care-giant-ascension-says-5-6-million-patients-affected-in-cyberattack/">Read full article</a></p>
