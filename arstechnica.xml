                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s an incredible time to be a guitarist who <em>doesn’t</em> want to own a bunch of $2,000 amps and an expensive pedalboard of gear. Amp and pedal simulators, which have been around for decades, have in the last few years finally come into their own as nearly indistinguishable sonic replacements. Even John Mayer is now <a href="https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/guitarists/john-mayer-neural-dsp-quad-cortex-coachella-2025">willing to ditch his beloved tube amps for digital models</a>.</p>
<p>I certainly don’t have Mayer’s chops or gear budget, but I do love messing with this sort of tech and have purchased everything from <a href="https://neuraldsp.com">NeuralDSP</a>‘s Archetypes series to <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitube5/?pkey=amplitube-5-max-v2">Amplitube</a> and Guitar Rig. Last week, as part of an early Black Friday sale, I even picked up two amp/effects suites from British developer Polychrome DSP—<a href="https://www.polychromedsp.com/nunchuck/">Nunchuck</a> (Marshall amps) and <a href="https://www.polychromedsp.com/lumos/">Lumos</a> (clean through mid-gain tones). They are both excellent.</p>
<p>Any reasonable person should be satisfied with this tech stack, which models gear that collectively costs as much as my house. After my Polychrome DSP purchases, I reminded myself that I was a reasonable person, and that I could therefore ignore any further amp sims that might tempt my wandering eye.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/guitar-amp-sims-have-gotten-astonishingly-good/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The top drug regulator at the Food and Drug Administration, Richard Pazdur, has decided to retire from the agency just three weeks after taking the leading position, according to multiple media outlets.</p>
<p>Pazdur, an oncologist who has worked at the FDA since 1999, was seen as a stabilizing force for an agency that has been mired in turmoil during the second Trump administration. He took over the role of leading the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research on November 11, after the previous leader, George Tidmarsh, left the agency amid an investigation and a lawsuit regarding allegations that he used his position to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/fda-described-as-clown-show-amid-latest-scandal-top-drug-regulator-is-out/">exact petty revenge</a> on a former business partner. In light of the scandal, one venture capital investor called the agency a “<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/04/fda-in-disarray-expert-analysis-george-tidmarsh-scandal/">clown show</a>.” Drug industry groups, meanwhile, called the FDA <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/21/fda-regulator-richard-pazdur-concerns/">erratic and unpredictable</a>.</p>
<p>Pazdur’s selection was seen as a positive sign by agency insiders, drug industry representatives, and patient advocacy groups, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/02/rick-pazdur-fda-resigns/">according to reporting by The Washington Post</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/more-fda-drama-top-drug-regulator-calls-it-quits-after-3-weeks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There’s a race in China among several companies vying to become the next to launch and land an orbital-class rocket, and the starting gun could go off as soon as tonight.</p>
<p>LandSpace, one of several maturing Chinese rocket startups, is about to launch the first flight of its medium-lift Zhuque-3 rocket. Liftoff could happen around 11 pm EST tonight (04:00 UTC Wednesday), or noon local time at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China.</p>
<p>Airspace warning notices advising pilots to steer clear of the rocket’s flight path suggest LandSpace has a launch window of about two hours. When it lifts off, the Zhuque-3 (Vermillion Bird-3) rocket will become the largest commercial launch vehicle ever flown in China. What’s more, LandSpace will become the first Chinese launch provider to attempt a landing of its first stage booster, using the same tried-and-true return method pioneered by SpaceX and, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/blue-origin-caps-second-heavy-lift-launch-with-first-offshore-landing/">more recently, Blue Origin</a> in the United States.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/this-chinese-company-could-become-the-countrys-first-to-land-a-reusable-rocket/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The shoe is most certainly on the other foot. On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” at the company to improve ChatGPT, delaying advertising plans and other products in the process,  The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-declares-code-red-combat-threats-chatgpt-delays-ads-effort">reported</a> based on a leaked internal memo. The move follows Google’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/">release</a> of its Gemini 3 model last month, which has outperformed ChatGPT on some industry benchmark tests and sparked high-profile praise on social media.</p>
<p>In the memo, Altman wrote, “We are at a critical time for ChatGPT.” The company will push back work on advertising integration, AI agents for health and shopping, and a personal assistant feature called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/chatgpt-pulse-delivers-morning-updates-based-on-your-chat-history/">Pulse</a>. Altman encouraged temporary team transfers and established daily calls for employees responsible for enhancing the chatbot.</p>
<p>The directive creates an odd symmetry with events from December 2022, when Google management <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/fearing-chatgpt-google-enlists-founders-brin-and-page-in-ai-fight/">declared</a> its own “code red” internal emergency after ChatGPT <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">launched</a> and rapidly gained in popularity. At the time, Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-management-issues-code-red-over-chatgpt-report-2022-12">reassigned</a> teams across the company to develop AI prototypes and products to compete with OpenAI’s chatbot. Now, three years later, the AI industry is in a very different place.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/openai-ceo-declares-code-red-as-gemini-gains-200-million-users-in-3-months/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><em>Mad Men</em> ran on the AMC channel for seven seasons from 2007 to 2015. The show had a vintage aesthetic, depicting the 1960s advertising industry in New York City.</p>
<p>Last month, HBO Max announced it would modernize the show by debuting a 4K version. The show originally aired in SD and HD resolutions and had not been previously made available in 4K through other means, such as Blu-ray.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/mad-mens-4k-debut-botched-by-hbo-max-streaming-episode-with-visible-crewmembers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple reportedly won’t comply with a government order in India to preload iPhones with a state-run app that can track and block lost or stolen phones via a device’s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code. While the government describes it as a tool to help consumers, privacy advocates say it could easily be repurposed for surveillance.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-resist-india-order-preload-state-run-app-political-outcry-builds-2025-12-02/">reported today</a>, citing three anonymous sources, that “Apple does not plan to comply with a mandate to preload its smartphones with a state-owned cyber safety app and will convey its concerns to New Delhi.” Reuters noted that the government mandate has “sparked surveillance concerns and a political uproar.”</p>
<p>The government’s Sanchar Saathi (“Communication Partner”) app is billed as a consumer tool for reporting suspected fraud communications, verifying the genuineness of a phone, and blocking lost or stolen handsets. The app can already be installed by users as it is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/sanchar-saathi/id6739700695">Apple</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dot.app.sancharsaathi&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a> app stores, but the government wants device makers such as Apple, Google, Samsung, and Xiaomi to load phones with the app before they are shipped.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/apple-will-refuse-to-preload-state-run-snooping-app-on-iphones-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>By Valve’s admission, its upcoming Steam Machine desktop isn’t swinging for the fences with its graphical performance. The specs promise decent 1080p-to-1440p performance in most games, with 4K occasionally reachable with assistance from FSR upscaling—about what you’d expect from a box with a modern midrange graphics card in it.</p>
<p>But there’s one spec that has caused some concern among Ars staffers and others with their eyes on the Steam Machine: The GPU comes with just 8GB of dedicated graphics RAM, an amount that is steadily becoming more of a bottleneck for midrange GPUs like AMD’s Radeon RX 7060 and 9060, or Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 or 5060.</p>
<p>In our reviews of these GPUs, we’ve already run into some games where the RAM ceiling limits performance in Windows, especially at 1440p. But we’ve been doing more extensive testing of various GPUs with SteamOS, and we can confirm that in current betas, 8GB GPUs struggle even more on SteamOS than they do running the same games at the same settings in Windows 11.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/steamos-has-problems-with-8gb-gpus-but-valve-is-working-on-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is following through on its pledge to split Android versions into more frequent updates. We already had one Android 16 release this year, and now it’s time for the second. The new version is rolling out first on Google’s Pixel phones, featuring more icon customization, easier parental controls, and AI-powered notifications. Don’t be bummed if you aren’t first in line for the new Android 16—Google also has a raft of general improvements coming to the wider Android ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Android 16, part 2</h2>
<p>Since rolling out the first version of Android in 2008, Google has largely stuck to one major release per year. Android 16 changes things, moving from one monolithic release to two. <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-16-december/">Today’s OS update</a> is the second part of the Android 16 era, but don’t expect major changes. As expected, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-review-post-hype/">first release in June</a> made more changes. Most of what we’ll see in the second update is geared toward Google’s Pixel phones, plus some less notable changes for developers.</p>
<p>Google’s new AI features for notifications are probably the most important change. Android 16 will use AI for two notification tasks: summarizing and organizing. The OS will take long chat conversations and summarize the notifications with AI. Notification data is processed locally on the device and won’t be uploaded anywhere. In the notification shade, the collapsed notification line will feature a summary of the conversation rather than a snippet of one message. Expanding the notification will display the full text.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-announces-second-android-16-release-of-2025-is-heading-to-pixels/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When the federal vaccine committee hand-picked by anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. meets again this week, it will have yet another new chairperson to lead its ongoing work of dismantling the evidence-based vaccine recommendations set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that the chairperson who has been in place since June—when Kennedy fired all 17 expert advisors on the committee and replaced them with questionably qualified allies—is moving to a senior role in the department. Biostatistician Martin Kulldorff will now be the chief science officer for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), HHS said. As such, he’s stepping down from the vaccine committee, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).</p>
<p>Kulldorff gained prominence amid the COVID-19 pandemic, criticizing public health responses to the crisis, particularly lockdowns and COVID-19 vaccines. He was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration that advocated for letting the deadly virus <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/white-house-informally-endorses-letting-pandemic-spread-unchecked/">spread unchecked through the population</a>, which was called unethical by health experts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/meet-cdcs-new-lead-vaccine-advisor-who-thinks-shots-cause-heart-disease/">Read full article</a></p>

The device’s two hinges are slightly different sizes because the phone’s three panels have distinct shapes. The center panel is the thickest at 4.2 mm, and the other two are fractions of a millimeter thinner. The phone has apparently been designed to account for the varying sizes and weights, allowing the frame to fold up tight in a pocketable form factor.</p>
<p>Huawei’s impressive Mate XT tri-fold phones have been making the rounds online, but they’re not available in Western markets. Samsung’s new foldable looks similar at a glance, but the way the three panels fit together is different. The Mate XT folds in a Z-shaped configuration, using part of the main screen as the cover display. On Samsung’s phone, the left and right segments fold inward behind the separate cover screen. Samsung claims it has tested the design extensively to verify that the hinges will hold up to daily use for years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-is-a-10-inch-tablet-that-fits-in-your-pocket/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Easter Island is famous for its giant monumental statues, called moai, built some 800 years ago. The volcanic rock used for the moai came from a quarry site called Rano Raraku. Archaeologists have created a high-resolution interactive 3D model of the quarry site to learn more about the processes used to create the moai. (You can explore the full interactive model <a href="https://gis-core.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/3dviewer/index.html?appid=233cada52d434e9fa4d1741c92e308da">here</a>.) According to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0336251">a paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE, the model shows that there were numerous independent groups, probably family clans, that created the moai, rather than a centralized management system.</p>
<p>“You can see things that you couldn’t actually see on the ground. You can see tops and sides and all kinds of areas that just would never be able to walk to,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1107271">said co-author Carl Lipo</a> of Binghamton University. “We can say, ‘Here, go look at it.’ If you want to see the different kinds of carving, fly around and see stuff there. We’re documenting something that really has needed to be documented, but in a way that’s really comprehensive and shareable.”</p>
<p>Lipo is one of the foremost experts on the Easter Island moai. In October, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/how-easter-islands-giant-statues-walked-to-their-final-platforms/">we reported</a> on Lipo’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440325002328?dgcid=author">experimental confirmation</a>—based on 3D modeling of the physics and new field tests to re-create that motion—that Easter Island’s people transported the statues in a vertical position, with workers using ropes to essentially “walk” the moai onto their platforms. To explain the presence of so many moai, the assumption has been that the island was once home to tens of thousands of people<em>. </em></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/explore-the-statues-of-easter-island-with-this-fly-through-3d-model/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>By the time the second group of NASA astronauts reach the Moon later this decade, the space agency would like to have a lunar rover waiting for them. But as the space agency nears a key selection, some government officials are seeking an insurance policy of sorts to increase the program’s chance of success.</p>
<p>At issue is the agency’s “Lunar Terrain Vehicle” (LTV) contract. In April 2024, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/nasa-asks-the-commercial-space-industry-for-a-rugged-long-lived-lunar-rover/">the space agency awarded</a> a few tens of millions of dollars to three companies—Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost, and Astrolab—to complete preliminary design work on vehicle concepts. NASA then planned to down-select to one company to construct one or more rovers, land on the Moon, and provide rover services for a decade beginning in 2029. Over the lifetime of the fixed-price services contract, there was a combined maximum potential value of $4.6 billion.</p>
<p>The companies have since completed their design work, including the construction of prototypes, and submitted their final bids for the much larger services contract in August. According to two sources, NASA has since been weighing those bids and is prepared to announce a final selection before the end of this month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/wary-of-picking-just-one-nasa-nears-important-decision-on-a-lunar-rover-selection/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>People often ask creatives—especially those in careers some dream of entering—”how did you get started?” Video game designers are no exception, and Avellone says that one of the most important keys to his success was one he learned early in his origin story.</p>
<p>“Players are selfish,” Avellone said, reflecting on his time designing the seminal computer roleplaying game <i>Planescape: Torment</i>. “The more you can make the experience all about them, the better. So <i>Torment</i> became that. Almost every single thing in the game is about you, the player.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/fallout-2-designer-chris-avellone-recalls-his-first-forays-into-game-development/">Read full article</a></p>

The findings reveal a weakness in how these models process instructions that may shed light on why some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/twitter-pranksters-derail-gpt-3-bot-with-newly-discovered-prompt-injection-hack/">prompt injection</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/sob-story-about-dead-grandma-tricks-microsoft-ai-into-solving-captcha/">jailbreaking</a> approaches work, though the researchers caution their analysis of some production models remains speculative since training data details of prominent commercial AI models are not publicly available.</p>
<p>The team, led by Chantal Shaib and Vinith M. Suriyakumar, tested this by asking models questions with preserved grammatical patterns but nonsensical words. For example, when prompted with “Quickly sit Paris clouded?” (mimicking the structure of “Where is Paris located?”), models still answered “France.”</p>
<p>This suggests models absorb both meaning and syntactic patterns, but can overrely on structural shortcuts when they strongly correlate with specific domains in training data, which sometimes allows patterns to override semantic understanding in edge cases. The team plans to present these findings at <a href="https://neurips.cc/">NeurIPS</a> later this month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/syntax-hacking-researchers-discover-sentence-structure-can-bypass-ai-safety-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Russian intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fired from an underground silo on the country’s southern steppe Friday on a scheduled test to deliver a dummy warhead to a remote impact zone nearly 4,000 miles away. The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet.</p>
<p>Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border.</p>
<p>A video posted by the <a href="https://t.me/militaryrussiaru/39856">Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram</a> and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/the-missile-meant-to-strike-fear-in-russias-enemies-fails-once-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Supreme Court justices expressed numerous concerns today in a case that could determine whether Internet service providers must terminate the accounts of broadband users accused of copyright infringement. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-171_4gd5.pdf">Oral arguments</a> were held in the case between cable Internet provider Cox Communications and record labels led by Sony.</p>
<p>Some justices were skeptical of arguments that ISPs should have no legal obligation under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to terminate an account when a user’s IP address has been repeatedly flagged for downloading pirated music. But justices also seemed hesitant to rule in favor of record labels, with some of the debate focusing on how ISPs should handle large accounts like universities where there could be tens of thousands of users.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor chided Cox for not doing more to fight infringement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/supreme-court-debates-whether-isps-must-kick-pirates-off-the-internet/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>At the heart of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/book-authors-sue-openai-and-meta-over-text-used-to-train-ai/">class-action lawsuit from authors</a> alleging that ChatGPT was illegally trained on their works, OpenAI’s decision to delete the datasets could end up being a deciding factor that gives the authors the win.</p>
<p>It’s undisputed that OpenAI deleted the datasets, known as “Books 1” and “Books 2,” prior to ChatGPT’s release in 2022. Created by former OpenAI employees in 2021, the datasets were built by scraping the open web and seizing the bulk of its data from a shadow library called Library Genesis (LibGen).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-desperate-to-avoid-explaining-why-it-deleted-pirated-book-datasets/">Read full article</a></p>

He had heard from a friend that Chinese companies were recruiting at new rare-earth mining sites in territory administered by the United Wa State Army, Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed group, and that workers could earn upwards of $1,400 a month.</p>
<p>It was an opportunity too good to pass up in a country where the formal economy has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1163706">collapsed</a> since the 2021 military coup, and <a href="https://www.undp.org/press-releases/middle-class-disappearing-and-poverty-deepening-myanmar">nearly half</a> of the population lives on less than $2 a day. So Sian set off by car for the town of Mong Pawk, then rode a motorbike for hours through the thick forest.</p>
<p>Hired for daily wages of approximately $21, he now digs boreholes and installs pipes. It is the first step in a <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/schoolforcross-facultystudies/research/projects/rare_earth_mining_myanmar/briefing_paper_2_the_rare_earth_mining_process_in_myanmar.pdf">process</a> called in situ<em> </em>leaching, which involves injecting acidic solutions into mountainsides, then collecting the drained solution in plastic-lined pools where solids, like dysprosium and terbium, two of the world’s most sought-after heavy rare-earth metals, settle out. The resulting sediment sludge is then transported to furnaces and burned, producing dry rare earth oxides.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/in-myanmar-illicit-rare-earth-mining-is-taking-a-heavy-toll/">Read full article</a></p>

At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/cd-projekt-red-offers-refunds-to-unsatisfied-cyberpunk-2077-console-players/">widespread technical issues with the console versions of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, which CDPR later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/cdpr-ceo-blames-in-game-streaming-for-cyberpunks-console-problems/">blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.”</a></p>
<p>“We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [<em>The Witcher 4</em>] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call. “In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time—as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between <em>TW4</em> and <em>TW5</em>, between <em>TW5</em> and <em>TW6</em> and so on.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-a-witcher-free-decade-cdpr-still-promises-three-sequels-in-six-years/">Read full article</a></p>
