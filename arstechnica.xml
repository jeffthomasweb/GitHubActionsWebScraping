                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Former Cloudflare executive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graham-Cumming">John Graham-Cumming</a> recently announced that he launched a <a href="https://lowbackgroundsteel.ai/">website</a>, lowbackgroundsteel.ai, that treats pre-AI, human-created content like a precious commodity—a time capsule of organic creative expression from a time before machines joined the conversation. "The idea is to point to sources of text, images and video that were created prior to the explosion of AI-generated content," Graham-Cumming <a href="https://blog.jgc.org/2025/06/low-background-steel-content-without-ai.html">wrote</a> on his blog last week. The reason? To preserve what made non-AI media uniquely human.</p>
<p>The archive name comes from a scientific phenomenon from the Cold War era. After nuclear weapons testing began in 1945, atmospheric radiation contaminated new steel production worldwide. For decades, scientists needing radiation-free metal for sensitive instruments had to salvage steel from pre-war shipwrecks. Scientists called this steel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-background_steel">"low-background steel."</a> Graham-Cumming sees a parallel with today's web, where AI-generated content increasingly mingles with human-created material and contaminates it.</p>
<p>With the advent of generative AI models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion in 2022, it has become far more difficult for researchers to ensure that media found on the Internet was created by humans without using AI tools. ChatGPT in particular triggered an avalanche of AI-generated text across the web, forcing at least one research project to shut down entirely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/why-one-man-is-archiving-human-made-content-from-before-the-ai-explosion/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>All 17 experts ousted from the federal vaccine advisory committee have spoken out about the drastic changes that anti-vaccine advocate and current US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made since taking office. Those changes include unilaterally restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines and summarily firing the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which had guided federal vaccine policies for more than 60 years.</p>
<p>"We are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people’s access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses," the fired experts write in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2835626">an editorial published in JAMA</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-fires-entire-cdc-panel-of-vaccine-advisors/">Kennedy dismissed the entire committee on June 9</a>, accusing the former members of lacking public trust and being "plagued with persistent conflicts of interest," despite the committee's transparent disclosure and conflict of interest policies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/all-17-fired-vaccine-advisors-unite-to-blast-rfk-jr-s-destabilizing-decisions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity practitioners are voicing concerns over a recent executive order issued by the White House that guts requirements for: securing software the government uses, punishing people who compromise sensitive networks, preparing new encryption schemes that will withstand attacks from quantum computers, and other existing controls.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/sustaining-select-efforts-to-strengthen-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-amending-executive-order-13694-and-executive-order-14144/">executive order</a> (EO), issued on June 6, reverses several key cybersecurity orders put in place by President Joe Biden, some as recently as a few days before his term ended in January. A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/sustaining-select-efforts-to-strengthen-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-amending-executive-order-13694-and-executive-order-14144/">statement</a> that accompanied Donald Trump's EO said the Biden directives "attempted to sneak problematic and distracting issues into cybersecurity policy" and amounted to "political football."</p>
<h2>Pro-business, anti-regulation</h2>
<p>Specific orders Trump dropped or relaxed included ones mandating (1) federal agencies and contractors adopt products with quantum-safe encryption as they become available in the marketplace, (2) a stringent Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) for software and services used by federal agencies and contractors, (3) the adoption of phishing-resistant regimens such as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/lapsus-and-solar-winds-hackers-both-use-the-same-old-trick-to-bypass-mfa.1483319/">WebAuthn standard</a> for logging into networks used by contractors and agencies, (4) the implementation new tools for securing Internet routing through the Border Gateway Protocol, and (5) the encouragement of digital forms of identity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/cybersecurity-take-a-big-hit-in-new-trump-executive-order/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/elon-musks-x-wins-appeal-to-block-california-content-moderation-law/">X won its fight to block a California law</a> requiring social media companies to report on efforts to remove hate speech and other kinds of content the state deemed harmful.</p>
<p>Now, X has sued to stop New York from enforcing a law that it claims is a "carbon copy" of California's—which resulted in a settlement blocking the California law after a court ruled it likely violated the First Amendment.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/X-Corp-V-Letitia-James-Complaint-6-17-25.pdf">complaint</a> filed Tuesday, X revealed that the New York lawsuit came after New York lawmakers rejected X's attempts to reconcile its social media law with the California ruling. Not only did lawmakers refuse to acknowledge free speech issues that X seemingly views as settled, but in a <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/admin/structure/media/manage/filefile/a/2024-09/twitter-letter.pdf">letter</a> declining to meet with X, they also called out X owner Elon Musk's controversial personal history of posting as a reason to refuse to engage with X.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/x-sues-to-block-copycat-ny-content-moderation-law-after-california-win/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Despite touting ambitious goals of making America healthier, the Trump administration on Monday revealed in court documents that it is backpedaling on a ban on cancer-causing asbestos.</p>
<p>Last year, under the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency took a long-awaited step to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/epa-finally-bans-the-last-type-of-asbestos-used-in-us/">ban the last type of asbestos still used in the US</a>—chrysotile asbestos, aka "white asbestos." While use of chrysotile asbestos was on the decline, the dangerous mineral has lingered in various gaskets, brake blocks, aftermarket automotive brakes and linings, other vehicle friction products, and some diaphragms used to make sodium hydroxide and chlorine.</p>
<p>With the ban, the US joined over 50 other countries around the world that had already banned its use due to health risks. Generally, asbestos is known to cause lung cancer, mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and laryngeal cancer. Asbestos exposure is linked to more than 40,000 deaths in the US alone each year, the EPA noted at the time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/trumps-epa-to-reconsider-ban-on-cancer-causing-asbestos/">Read full article</a></p>

      The second and final season of <em>The Sandman</em> comes to Netflix next month.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Netflix's <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-netflixs-exquisite-the-sandman-is-the-stuff-dreams-are-made-of/">The Sandman</a>,</em> an exquisite and largely faithful adaptation of Neil Gaiman's beloved graphic novel series, proved to be a hit for the streaming giant, racking up nearly 400 million viewing hours between its release on August 5 and September 18, 2022. Yet there was initially some question about whether even those numbers were strong enough to justify a second season of the critically acclaimed series, which cost a bundle to make. Fortunately, Netflix made the right call and renewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(TV_series)"><em>The Sandman</em></a> for a second and final season. And judging by the official trailer, it should be every bit as lavish and riveting as its predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>The first half of S1 covered Morpheus/Dream's (Tom Sturridge) capture and long imprisonment by British aristocrat Roderick Burgess (Charles Dance) and later his son Alex (Laurie Kynaston). Once he escaped, Dream found that his realm, the Dreaming, had fallen into decay, and he had to retrieve his scattered totems (his helm, a pouch of sand, and a ruby) in order to rebuild it. In the second half, Dream tracked an escaped nightmare called The Corinthian (Boyd Holbrook), now a prolific serial killer. Everything converged on a young woman named Rose Walker (Kyo Ra), an unwitting Vortex—someone who can attract and manipulate dreams, with dire consequences.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/prepare-to-bid-farewell-to-the-sandman-with-s2-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After Mattel and OpenAI announced a partnership that would result in an AI product marketed to kids, a consumer rights advocacy group is warning that the collaboration may endanger children.</p>
<p>It remains unclear what shape Mattel's first AI product will take. However, on Tuesday, Public Citizen co-President Robert Weissman issued a statement urging more transparency so that parents can prepare for potential risks. Weissman is particularly concerned that ChatGPT-fueled toys could hurt kids in unknown ways.</p>
<p>"Endowing toys with human-seeming voices that are able to engage in human-like conversations risks inflicting real damage on children," Weissman said. "It may undermine social development, interfere with children’s ability to form peer relationships, pull children away from playtime with peers, and possibly inflict long-term harm."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/mattel-sparks-fear-that-planned-chatgpt-fueled-toys-will-warp-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has announced a big expansion of its Gemini AI model family today. After months of tweaking and tuning, the high-power <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a> is leaving preview and is ready for developers to build on. Meanwhile, Google is offering a peek at its upcoming high-efficiency model, known as Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash-Lite. Try as it might, Google can't get away from confusing model names.</p>
<p>Google's AI aspirations have been looking up in 2025 with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">debut of Gemini 2.5</a>. These models showed a marked improvement over past versions, making Google more competitive with OpenAI and its popular GPT models. However, we've been inundated with previews and test builds as Google works toward general availability, which means a model is stable enough for long-term development work.</p>
<p>The 2.5 Flash model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/gemini-2-5-is-leaving-preview-just-in-time-for-googles-new-250-ai-subscription/">left preview</a> at I/O, but Gemini 2.5 Pro lagged behind. Today, Flash is hitting general availability with the 04-17 build. Gemini 2.5 Pro is leaving preview and also reaching general availability, and as predicted, the recently revamped 06-05 build is the winner. This version aimed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-releases-updated-gemini-2-5-pro-says-its-the-most-intelligent-model-yet/">address some issues</a> that popped up in the Google I/O build of 2.5 Pro, and it appears to have worked.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/googles-gemini-ai-family-updated-with-stable-2-5-pro-super-efficient-2-5-flash-lite/">Read full article</a></p>

      "Sally Ride became the first American woman to blast off into space, but beneath her unflappable composure, she carried a secret."

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>On June 18, 1983, NASA astronaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride">Sally Ride</a> made history as the first American woman in space aboard the Space Shuttle <em>Challenger</em>. National Geographic is marking the occasion with a new documentary on the astronaut's life: <em>Sally</em>. In addition to revisiting her storied career, the film provides an unprecedented look at the famously private Ride's personal life—notably her nearly 30-year relationship with another woman.</p>
<p>Director Cristina Costantini's prior work includes the 2018 Emmy-nominated National Geographic documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Fair_(film)"><em>Science Fair</em></a>, chronicling nine teenagers' paths to competing in the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Intel International Science and Engineering Fair" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_International_Science_and_Engineering_Fair">Intel International Science and Engineering Fair</a>. So perhaps it's not surprising that Costantini is a longtime fan of Ride since childhood. "It was just, if a girl can go to space and do all these things that women aren't supposed to do, maybe I can do big things, too," she told Ars. "I think a lot of women have the exact same reaction. If she can do it, we can do it. As I got older and I learned more about Sally, I realized, wow, she really had a very fine line to walk and she did it so masterfully."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ride died of pancreatic cancer in 2012, which is when Costantini and much of the rest of the world discovered that the astronaut's business partner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam_O%27Shaughnessy">Tam O'Shaughnessy</a>, was also Ride's romantic partner and had been for 27 years. "I thought, oh my God, if NASA was barely ready for women, what was this like?" said Costantini. "What was beneath the story that we had been fed our entire lives of who Sally really was? I wanted to make a film that celebrated the Sally we all knew and also celebrated the Sally we didn't know and complicate her legacy and make her a real person."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/natgeos-sally-explores-public-and-private-faces-of-sally-ride/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump Organization's <a href="https://www.trump.com/media/trump-mobile-launches-a-bold-new-wireless-service">rollout</a> of Trump Mobile on Monday—a new wireless service using Trump's image to sell smartphones—was notably messy. Not only did the website reportedly glitch while processing preorders (more on that below), but soon after its launch, at least one glaring mistake on the website had to be quickly changed.</p>
<p>Critics on social media were quick to point out that the Trump Mobile coverage map used the Gulf of Mexico instead of using Trump's controversial new name for the body of water, the Gulf of America, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-mobile-pulls-coverage-map-after-gulf-mexico-label-sparks-chatter-online-2025-06-17/">reported</a>. Trump has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5305226/ap-sues-white-house-gulf-of-america-mexico-trump">sued for penalizing AP News</a> for failing to adopt the label, so a wireless service bearing his name would be expected to fall in line. Mocked with screenshots, the Trump Organization yanked the coverage map within hours of launching the site, breaking links and generating errors on Tuesday, confirming that "the page could not be found."</p>
<h2>Trump Mobile launched Monday</h2>
<p>According to the press release, Trump Mobile's "flagship" wireless plan will be "The 47 Plan," which references Trump's current term as the United States' 47th president.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trump-org-launches-47-month-wireless-service-teases-odd-499-phone/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI executives have discussed filing an antitrust complaint with US regulators against Microsoft, the company's largest investor, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f">reported</a> Monday, marking a dramatic escalation in tensions between the two long-term AI partners. OpenAI, which develops <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, has reportedly considered seeking a federal regulatory review of the terms of its contract with Microsoft for potential antitrust law violations, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The potential antitrust complaint would likely argue that Microsoft is using its dominant position in cloud services and contractual leverage to suppress competition, according to insiders who described it as a "nuclear option," the WSJ reports.</p>
<p>The move could unravel one of the most important business partnerships in the AI industry—a relationship that started with a $1 billion investment by Microsoft in 2019 and has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/openai-and-microsoft-reaffirm-shared-quest-for-powerful-ai-with-new-investment/">grown</a> to include <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/regulators-arent-convinced-that-microsoft-and-openai-operate-independently/">billions more</a> in funding, along with Microsoft's exclusive rights to host OpenAI models on its Azure cloud platform.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/openai-weighs-nuclear-option-of-antitrust-complaint-against-microsoft/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Chevrolet provided flights from Los Angeles to Austin, Texas, and accommodation so Ars could be briefed on the new ZR1X and drive the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-first-drive-engineered-for-insane-speed.1507627/">ZR1</a>. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>At the recent media launch of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-first-drive-engineered-for-insane-speed.1507627/">ZR1</a>, the most powerful Corvette ever, Chevrolet also teased an even more potent variant set to debut later this year. Dubbed the ZR1X, the latest model arrives after serious anticipation that began swirling when the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/the-corvette-goes-mid-engined-supercar-performance-for-60000/">eighth-gen ‘Vette switched to a mid-engine layout</a>—and especially after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/heres-everything-we-know-about-the-2024-corvette-e-ray-hybrid/">E-Ray hybrid</a> justified the design's enormous center console by filling the backbone with batteries to power a small front electric motor.</p>
<p>Hype online ahead of the official unveil nicknamed the top-spec car "Zora" after Zora Arkus-Duntov, the GM engineer known as the "Father of the Corvette." But instead, ZR1X follows the industry's typical alphanumeric nomenclature, where, as usual, X means all-wheel drive. The ZR1X, therefore, uses the same recipe by complementing the ZR1's 1,064 hp (783 kW) twin-turbocharged V8 with a front electric motor, resulting in a claimed combined rating of 1,250 hp (919 kW).</p>
<p>The same 1.9 kWh battery pack now holds 26 percent more charge than in the E-Ray, which helps bump the front motor's output from 160 to 186 hp (117 to 132 kW) and from 125 to 145 lb-ft (169 to 196 Nm). This allows GM to predict that the ZR1X will achieve a 0–60 mph (0–96 kph) time under two seconds, made possible by all-wheel-drive traction off the line.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/the-first-corvette-hypercar-chevrolets-1250-hp-zr1x-hybrid-breaks-cover/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, the makers of the popular Mig Flash cartridge, which allows users to play Switch games loaded via an SD card without modifying the console itself, <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1933967207840514159">issued a firmware update</a> enabling the cards to run original Switch games on the Switch 2. Since then, though, multiple Mig Flash users are reporting that they've seen their Switch 2 consoles banned from Nintendo's online servers, even in cases where the devices were only used to run backups of legitimate games the users purchased themselves.</p>
<p>"My Switch 2 test has been banned after using the Mig [Flash] with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something," popular hacking news account Switch Tools <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools">posted on social media Monday</a> (along with <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1934723908676338036">a follow-up showing a stack of legitimate Switch games</a> they said they had backed up using the device). "I strongly recommend that you do not use the Mig [Flash], it was already very risky to use but it is even more so on Switch 2."</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My Switch 2 test has been banned, after using the mig switch with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something<br>
Similar reports on reddit are starting to come in.<a href="https://t.co/nbPMlRWSaP">https://t.co/nbPMlRWSaP</a><a href="https://t.co/3eq6dkbFMi">https://t.co/3eq6dkbFMi</a><br>

<p>The insistence that the ban came while using "perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges" is important here. Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/inside-nintendos-perfect-method-for-detecting-online-switch-piracy/">long used certificates with robust cryptographic signatures</a> to identify when individual copies of Switch games are being shared for the purposes of piracy. If Nintendo notices the same cryptographic signature on security certificates being used by hundreds of different consoles and accounts, for instance, the company can be relatively sure that all those users are engaging in piracy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/playing-personal-game-backups-could-get-your-switch-2-banned-by-nintendo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration has locked horns with a federal judge who ruled on Monday that more than $1 billion in DEI-fueled cuts to federal health research clearly discriminated against racial minorities and LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>In what The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/us/politics/trump-nih-grants-cut.html">dubbed</a> a “damning assessment” of Trump’s motives, Judge Williams G. Young ruled from the bench that the cuts were “void and illegal,” saying it was his “duty” to immediately order funding restored.</p>
<p>“I would be blind not to call it out,” Young said, declaring that in 40 years, he has “never seen government racial discrimination like this. This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community,” he said. “That’s what this is.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-slams-nih-grant-cuts-as-racist-appalling-white-house-attacks-judge/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On a sunny April afternoon in Seattle, around 40 activists gathered at the Pine Box, a beer and pizza bar in the sometimes scruffy Capitol Hill neighborhood. The group had reserved a side room attached to the outside patio; before remarks began, attendees flowed in and out, enjoying the warm day. Someone set up a sound system. Then the activists settled in, straining their ears as the streamed call crackled through less-than-perfect speakers.</p>
<p>In more than a decade of climate organizing, it was the first time Emily Johnston, one of the group’s leaders, had attended a happy hour to listen to a company’s quarterly earnings call. Also the first time a local TV station showed up to cover such a happy hour. “This whole campaign has been just a magnet for attention,” she says.</p>
<p>The group, officially called the Troublemakers, was rewarded right away. <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/tesla/">Tesla</a>CEO <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> started the investors’ call for the first quarter of 2025 with a sideways acknowledgement of exactly the work the group had been doing for the past two months. He called out the nationwide backlash to the so-called <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/doge/">Department of Government Efficiency</a>, or DOGE, an effort to cut government spending staffed by young tech enthusiasts and Musk company alumni, named—with typical Muskian Internet-brained flourish—for an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/">early 2010s meme</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/how-tesla-takedown-got-its-start/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the last three years, we've engaged in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-case-for-and-against-macos-15-sequoia-being-the-final-release-for-intel-macs/">some in-depth data analysis and tea-leaf reading</a> to answer two questions about Apple's support for older Macs that still use Intel chips.</p>
<p>First, was Apple providing fewer updates and fewer years of software support to Macs based on Intel chips as it worked to transition the entire lineup to its internally developed Apple Silicon? And second, how long could Intel Mac owners reasonably expect to keep getting updates?</p>
<p>The answer to the first question has always been "it depends, but generally yes." And this year, we have a definitive answer to the second question: For the bare handful of Intel Macs it supports, macOS 26 Tahoe will be the final new version of the operating system to support any of Intel's chips.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/one-last-look-at-software-support-as-macos-26-tahoe-winds-down-the-intel-mac-era/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The first-generation Nissan Leaf was an incredible achievement for the company and for the industry. A mass-market EV that wasn't priced out of reach was something the industry needed at the time.</p>
<p>That's important. Since then, things have stagnated. To say that the 2026 Leaf is the most important EV launch for Nissan since the original car would be an understatement. It must get it right, because the competition is too good not to.</p>
<p>Starting things off, the car is available with two battery options. There is a 52 kWh base pack and a 75 kWh longer-range option. Each option has an active thermal management system—a first for Leaf—to address DC fast-charging concerns. Those batteries also deliver more range, with up to 303 miles (488 km) on the S+ model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/everything-we-know-about-the-2026-nissan-leaf/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While COVID-19 transmission remains low in the US, health experts are anxious about the potential for a big summer wave as two factors seem set for a collision course: a lull in infection activity that suggests protective responses have likely waned in the population, and a new SARS-CoV-2 variant with an infectious advantage over other variants.</p>
<p>The new variant is dubbed NB.1.8.1. Like all the other currently circulating variants, it's a descendant of omicron. Specifically, NB.1.8.1 is derived from the recombinant variant XDV.1.5.1. Compared to the reigning omicron variants JN.1 and LP.8.1, the new variant has a few mutations that could help it bind to human cells more easily and evade some protective immune responses.</p>
<p>On May 23, the World Health Organization <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf">designated NB.1.8.1</a> a "variant under monitoring," <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-working-definitions-and-primary-actions-for--sars-cov-2-variants">meaning</a> that early signals indicate it has an advantage over other variants, but its impact on populations is not yet clear. In recent weeks, parts of Asia, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, have experienced increases in infections and hospitalizations linked to NB.1.8.1's spread. Fortunately, the variant does not appear to cause more severe disease, and current vaccines are expected to remain effective against it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/new-covid-variant-swiftly-gains-ground-in-us-concern-looms-for-summer-wave/">Read full article</a></p>

      Liam Neeson stars as Lt. Frank Drebin Jr. in <em>The Naked Gun</em>.

</div>
<p>Thirty years after the last film in <em>The Naked Gun</em> crime-spoof comedy franchise, we're finally getting a new installment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_Gun_(2025_film)"><em>The Naked Gun</em></a>, described as a "legacy sequel." And it's Liam Neeson stepping into Leslie Nielsen's fumbling shoes, playing that character's son. Judging by the official trailer, Neeson is up to the task, showcasing his screwball comedy chops.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the first three films in the franchise below.)</strong></p>
<p>The original <em>Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!</em> debuted in 1988, with Leslie Nielsen starring as Detective Frank Drebin, trying to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to the US. It proved successful enough to launch two sequels. <em>Naked Gun 2-1/2: The Smell of Fear</em> (1991) found Drebin battling an evil plan to kidnap a prominent nuclear scientist. <em>Naked Gun 33-1/3: The Final Insult</em> (1994) found Drebin coming out of retirement and going undercover to take down a crime syndicate planning to blow up the Academy Awards.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/liam-neeson-is-justices-new-daddy-in-naked-gun-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>
