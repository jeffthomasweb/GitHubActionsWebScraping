            <![CDATA[3D-printed gun parts are worth real money on the black market.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's a truism at this point to say that Americans own a lot of guns. Case in point: This week, a fire chief in rural Alabama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/fire-chief-shot-deer-alabama.html">stopped to help a driver who had just hit a deer</a>. The two men walked up the driveway of a nearby home. For reasons that remain unclear, a man came out of the house with a gun and started shooting. This was a bad idea on many levels, but most practically because <em>both the fire chief and the driver were also armed</em>. Between the three of them, everyone got shot, the fire chief died, and the man who lived in the home was charged with murder.</p>
<p>But despite the ease of acquiring legal weapons, a robust black market still exists to traffic in things like "ghost guns" (no serial numbers) and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdok/media/1366621/dl?inline">machine gun converters</a> (which make a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic). According to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-atfs-publication-final-volume-national-firearms-commerce-and">major new report</a> released this month by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, there was a 1,600 percent increase in the use of privately made "ghost guns" during crimes between 2017 and 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, the seizure of machine gun converters also increased by 784 percent.</p>
<p>Ars Technica has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/with-founder-out-on-bail-whats-next-for-3d-gun-printer-defense-distributed/">covered these issues for years</a>, since both "ghost guns" and machine gun converters can be produced using 3D-printed parts, the schematics for which are now widely available online. But you can know about an issue and still be surprised when local prosecutors start talking about black market trafficking rings, inept burglary schemes, murder—and 3D printing operations being run out of a local apartment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/3d-printed-ghost-gun-ring-comes-to-my-community-and-leaves-a-man-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization has begun cost-cutting measures in preparation for a US withdrawal next year, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/who-chief-cut-costs-reset-priorities-after-us-exit-document-shows-2025-01-24/">according to reporting by Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>On his first day in office, President Trump<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-orders-us-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/"> signed an executive order to withdraw the US</a> from the United Nation's health agency.

The executive order cited Trump's long-standing complaints about the agency's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, dues payments, and alleged protection of China as the reasons for the withdrawal.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/21-01-2025-who-comments-on-united-states--announcement-of-intent-to-withdraw">a statement on Tuesday</a>, the WHO said it "regrets" the announcement and hopes the US will reconsider.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/who-starts-cutting-costs-as-us-withdrawal-date-set-for-january-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Nvidia last dropped Game Ready driver support for older GPUs in 2021.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia is launching the first volley of RTX 50-series GPUs based on its new Blackwell architecture, starting with the RTX 5090 and working downward from there. The company also appears to be winding down support for a few of its older GPU architectures, according to these <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html">CUDA release notes</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpu-drivers/nvidia-starts-phasing-out-maxwell-pascal-and-volta-gpus-geforce-driver-support-status-unclear">Tom's Hardware</a>.</p>
<p>The release notes say that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPU architectures "is considered feature-complete and will be frozen in an upcoming release." While all of these architectures—which collectively cover GeForce GPUs from the old GTX 700 series all the way up through 2016's GTX 1000 series, plus a couple of Quadro and Titan workstation cards—are still currently supported by Nvidia's December Game Ready driver package, the end of new CUDA feature support suggests that these GPUs will eventually be dropped from these driver packages soon.</p>
<p>It's common for Nvidia and AMD to drop support for another batch of architectures all at once every few years; Nvidia last dropped support for older cards <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-drops-kepler-windows-7-8-8.1-support/">in 2021</a>, and AMD dropped support for several prominent GPUs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-pulls-back-on-drivers-for-aging-but-popular-graphics-cards-and-igpus/">in 2023</a>. Both companies maintain a separate driver branch for some of their older cards but releases usually only happen every few months, and they focus on security updates, not on providing new features or performance optimizations for new games.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-winding-down-support-for-older-gpus-including-the-legendary-750-ti-and-1060/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic announced <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-citations-api">Citations</a>, a new API feature that helps Claude models avoid confabulations (also called hallucinations) by linking their responses directly to source documents. The feature lets developers add documents to Claude's context window, enabling the model to automatically cite specific passages it uses to generate answers.</p>
<p>"When Citations is enabled, the API processes user-provided source documents (PDF documents and plaintext files) by chunking them into sentences," Anthropic says. "These chunked sentences, along with user-provided context, are then passed to the model with the user's query."</p>
<p>The company describes several potential uses for Citations, including summarizing case files with source-linked key points, answering questions across financial documents with traced references, and powering support systems that cite specific product documentation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-adds-citations-in-bid-to-avoid-confabulating-ai-models/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The game of chess has long been central to computer science and AI-related research, most notably in IBM's Deep Blue in the 1990s and, more recently, AlphaZero. But the game is about more than algorithms, according to <a href="https://www.quanturb.com/about-me">Marc Barthelemy</a>, a physicist at the Paris-Saclay University in France, with layers of depth arising from the psychological complexity conferred by player strategies.</p>
<p>Now, Barthelmey has taken things one step further by publishing a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014314">new paper</a> in the journal Physical Review E that treats chess as a complex system, producing a handy metric that can help predict the proverbial "tipping points" in chess matches.</p>
<p>In his paper, Barthelemy cites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_R%C3%A9ti">Richard Reti</a>, an early 20th-century chess master who gave a series of lectures in the 1920s on developing a scientific understanding of chess. It was an ambitious program involving collecting empirical data, constructing typologies, and devising laws based on those typologies, but Reti's insights fell by the wayside as advances in computer science came to dominate the field. That's understandable. "With its simple rules yet vast strategic depth, chess provides an ideal platform for developing and testing algorithms in AI, machine learning, and decision theory," Barthelemy writes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/complexity-physics-finds-crucial-tipping-points-in-chess-games/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last year, a study highlighted that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/your-doctors-office-could-be-reading-your-blood-pressure-all-wrong/">your doctor's office might be taking your blood pressure wrong</a>. The current best practice is to take seated blood pressure readings with a detailed protocol: Patients must not eat, drink, or exercise for 30 minutes prior; they must have an empty bladder and sit calmly for five minutes prior to the first reading; they must sit with their feet uncrossed and flat on the floor; their back should be supported; and—a big one that's often overlooked—they must keep the arm to be measured resting on a flat surface at the height of their heart, not higher or lower.</p>
<p>While the setup is often different from what happens in a bustling medical office, a new study blows away quibbles over protocol and suggests that even when done perfectly, the method is second-rate. We shouldn't be sitting at all when we take our blood pressure—we should be lying down.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2828914">the study, published in JAMA Cardiology and led by researchers at Harvard</a>, blood pressure readings measured while lying down were significantly better at indicating risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and death than were seated blood pressure readings alone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/for-real-we-may-be-taking-blood-pressure-readings-all-wrong/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When New York's law requiring $15 or $20 broadband plans for people with low incomes took effect last week, Optimum customer William O'Brien tried to sign up for the cheap Internet service. Since O'Brien is in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), he qualifies for one of the affordable plans that Internet service providers must offer New Yorkers who meet income eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>O'Brien has been paying Optimum $111.20 a month for broadband—$89.99 for the broadband service, $14 in equipment rental fees, a $6 "Network Enhancement Fee," and $1.21 in tax. He was due for a big discount under the <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GBS/399-ZZZZZ">New York Affordable Broadband Act (ABA)</a>, which says that any ISP with over 20,000 customers must offer either a $15 plan with download speeds of at least 25Mbps or a $20 plan with at least 200Mbps speeds, and that the price must include "any recurring taxes and fees such as recurring rental fees for service provider equipment required to obtain broadband service and usage fees."</p>
<p>Despite qualifying for a low-income plan under the law's criteria, O'Brien's request was denied by Optimum. He reached out to Ars, just like many other people who have read our articles about bad telecom customer service. Usually, these problems are fixed quickly after we reach out to an Internet provider's public relations department on the customer's behalf.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/isp-failed-to-comply-with-new-yorks-15-broadband-law-until-ars-got-involved/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Even setting aside Frame Generation, this is a fast, power-hungry $2,000 GPU.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 starts at $1,999 before you factor in upsells from the company's partners or price increases driven by scalpers and/or genuine demand. It costs more than my entire gaming PC.</p>
<p>The new GPU is so expensive that you could build an entire well-specced gaming PC with Nvidia's next-fastest GPU in it—the $999 RTX 5080, which we don't have in hand yet—for the same money, or maybe even a little less with judicious component selection. It's not the most expensive GPU that Nvidia has ever launched—2018's $2,499 Titan RTX has it beat, and 2022's RTX 3090 Ti also cost $2,000—but it's safe to say it's not really a GPU intended for the masses.</p>
<p>At least as far as gaming is concerned, the 5090 is the very definition of a halo product; it's for people who demand the best and newest thing regardless of what it costs (the calculus is probably different for deep-pocketed people and companies who want to use them as some kind of generative AI accelerator). And on this front, at least, the 5090 is successful. It's the newest and fastest GPU you can buy, and the competition is not particularly close. It's also a showcase for DLSS Multi-Frame Generation, a new feature unique to the 50-series cards that Nvidia is leaning on heavily to make its new GPUs look better than they already are.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/review-nvidias-geforce-rtx-5090-is-the-first-gpu-that-can-beat-the-rtx-4090/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the most frequently asked questions about quantum computers is a simple one: When will they be useful?</p>
<p>If you talk to people in the field, you'll generally get a response in the form of another question: useful for what? Quantum computing can be applied to a large range of problems, some of them considerably more complex than others. Utility will come for some of the simpler problems first, but further hardware progress is needed before we can begin tackling some of the more complex ones.</p>
<p>One that should be easiest to solve involves modeling the behavior of some simple catalysts. The electrons of these catalysts, which are critical for their chemical activity, obey the rules of quantum mechanics, which makes it relatively easy to explore them with a quantum computer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/researchers-optimize-simulations-of-molecules-on-quantum-computers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>About a year ago, security researcher Sam Curry bought his mother a Subaru, on the condition that, at some point in the near future, she let him hack it.</p>
<p>It took Curry until last November, when he was home for Thanksgiving, to begin examining the 2023 Impreza's Internet-connected features and start looking for ways to exploit them. Sure enough, he and a researcher working with him online, Shubham Shah, soon discovered vulnerabilities in a Subaru web portal that let them hijack the ability to unlock the car, honk its horn, and start its ignition, reassigning control of those features to any phone or computer they chose.</p>
<p>Most disturbing for Curry, though, was that they found they could also track the Subaru's location—not merely where it was at the moment but also where it had been for the entire year that his mother had owned it. The map of the car’s whereabouts was so accurate and detailed, Curry says, that he was able to see her doctor visits, the homes of the friends she visited, even which exact parking space his mother parked in every time she went to church.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/millions-of-subarus-could-be-remotely-unlocked-tracked-due-to-security-flaws/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.28 of the Rocket Report! After last week's jam-packed action in the launch business, things are a bit quieter this week. Much of the space world's attention has turned to Washington as the Trump administration takes the helm of the federal government. Some of the administration's policy changes will likely impact the launch industry, with commercial spaceflight poised to become a beneficiary of actions over the next four years. As for the specifics, Ars has reported that NASA is expected to review the future of the Space Launch System rocket. Investments in the military space program could bring in more business for launch companies. And regulatory changes may reduce government oversight of commercial spaceflight.</p>

<p><b>What happened to China's reusable rocket testbed? </b>A Chinese state-owned company performed a rocket flight on January 18 (US time) aimed at testing reusable launch vehicle technology without announcing the outcome, <a href="https://spacenews.com/china-performs-high-altitude-reusable-rocket-test-with-uncertain-outcome/">Space News reports</a>. The Longxing-2 test article lifted off from a makeshift launch area near Haiyang, Shandong province. The methane-fueled rocket was expected to fly to an altitude of 75 kilometers (about 246,000 feet) before performing a reentry burn and a landing burn to guide itself to a controlled splashdown in the Yellow Sea, replicating the maneuvers required to recover a reusable booster like the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9. This was China's most ambitious reusable rocket demonstration flight to date.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/rocket-report-dot-may-review-spacex-fines-did-chinas-reusable-rocket-work/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can’t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that.</p>
<p>J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.</p>
<h2>Open sesame</h2>
<p>The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumin Technology’s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Four out of five game developers are currently working on a project for the PC, a sizable increase from 66 percent of developers a year ago. That's according to <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Informa's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a>, which partnered with Omdia to ask over 3,000 game industry professionals about their work in advance of March's Game Developers Conference.</p>
<p>The 80 percent of developers working on PC projects in this year's survey is by far the highest mark for any platform dating back to at least 2018, when 60 percent of surveyed developers were working on a PC game. In the years since, the ratio of game developers working on the PC has hovered between 56 and 66 percent before this year's unexpected jump. The number of game developers saying they were <em>interested</em> in the PC as a platform also increased substantially, from 62 percent last year to 74 percent this year.</p>

      While the PC has long been the most popular platform in this survey, the sudden jump in the last year was rather large.

<p>The PC has long been the most popular platform for developers to work on in the annual State of the Game Industry survey, easily outpacing consoles and mobile platforms that generally see active work from anywhere between 12 to 36 percent of developer respondents, depending on the year. In its report, Informa notes this surge as a "passion for PC development explod[ing]" among developers, and mentions that while "PC has consistently been the platform of choice... this year saw its dominance increase even more."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/way-more-game-makers-are-working-on-pc-titles-than-ever-survey-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI released a research preview of "<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/">Operator</a>," a web automation tool that uses a new AI model called <a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/">Computer-Using Agent</a> (CUA) to control a web browser through a visual interface. The system performs tasks by viewing and interacting with on-screen elements like buttons and text fields similar to how a human would.</p>
<p>Operator is available today for subscribers of the $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan at <a href="https://operator.chatgpt.com/">operator.chatgpt.com</a>. The company plans to expand to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users later. OpenAI intends to integrate these capabilities directly into ChatGPT and later release CUA through its API for developers.</p>
<p>Operator watches on-screen content in its virtual environment while it uses an internal browser and executes tasks through simulated keyboard and mouse inputs. The Computer-Using Agent processes screenshots of its browser interface to understand the browser's state and then makes decisions about clicking, typing, and scrolling based on its observations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">All federal agencies received a <a href="https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/OPM%20Return%20to%20Office%20Guidance%20Memorandum%201-22-25.pdf">memo</a> Wednesday requiring the termination of remote work options, with return-to-office plans due by end of day Friday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, Charles Ezell, told the heads and acting heads of all departments and agencies that the change is due to Donald Trump's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/">Return to In-Person Work</a> presidential memorandum, which carved out space for some exemptions and ordered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Heads of all departments and agencies in the executive branch of Government shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis, provided that the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Empty offices a “national embarrassment”</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the memo, "most federal offices presently are virtually abandoned," with "the vast majority of federal office workers" having "not returned to in-person work" after transitioning to remote work during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only has this "devastated" the local economy in Washington, D.C., the memo said, but having so many federal offices sitting empty also serves as a "national embarrassment."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/all-federal-agencies-ordered-to-terminate-remote-work-ideally-within-30-days/">Read full article</a></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last weekend, TikTok briefly went dark in the US, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/after-chaotic-weekend-tiktok-remains-in-limbo/">only to come back online hours later</a> after Donald Trump reassured ByteDance that the US law would not be enforced. Then, shortly after Trump took office, he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-day-one-orders-saving-tiktok-creating-doge-and-ending-censorship/">signed an executive order</a> delaying enforcement for 75 days while he consulted with advisers to "pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's executive order did not suggest that he intended to attempt to override the national security law's ban-or-sale requirements. But that hasn't stopped ByteDance, board member Bill Ford told World Economic Forum (WEF) attendees, from searching for a potential non-sale option that "could involve a change of control locally to ensure it complies with US legislation," Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/tiktok-deal-could-stop-short-of-full-us-sale-shareholder-says">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-can-save-tiktok-without-forcing-a-sale-bytedance-board-member-claims/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The modern <em>Doom</em> games have been a master class in reviving a beloved retro gaming series. Both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/">2016's <em>Doom</em></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/">2020's <em>Doom Eternal</em></a> paid homage to both the look and feel of the original <em>Doom</em> titles without being slavishly devoted to older gameplay conventions that can feel dated decades later.</p>
<p>Yet by the end of <em>Doom Eternal</em>, you could feel the modernized gameplay system threatening to burst at the seams a bit. Managing your limited ammo, health, and armor resources in <em>Eternal</em> meant expertly juggling a bewildering array of chainsaws, flamethrowers, grenades, and melee-based staggers into powerful, pre-animated "glory kills." That was all on top of the frequent weapon-switching needed to take advantage of the weaknesses of the varied enemies surrounding you and the double-jump-and-dash movement system that required expert use of all three dimensions.</p>
<p>Something had to give. So for <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, the team at id Software has committed to a more streamlined, back-to-basics system that limits complexity while maintaining the same overall difficulty level. That means a "fewer strings on the guitar" approach to controls that narrows almost every action down to just three context-sensitive buttons, as the developers discussed in a hands-off virtual preview session attended by Ars Technica.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's official: The FBI's warrantless searches of communications seized to protect US national security have at last been ruled unconstitutional and in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p>In a major December <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/US-v-Hasbajrami-Ruling-1-21-25.pdf">ruling</a> made public this week, US District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall settled one of the biggest debates about feared government overreach that has prompted calls to reform Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Critics' primary concern was whether the FBI needed a warrant to search and query Americans' communications that are often incidentally, inadvertently, or mistakenly seized during investigations of suspected foreign terrorists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/court-rules-fbis-warrantless-searches-violated-fourth-amendment/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has revived three complaints against broadcast stations accused of bias against President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Outgoing Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel last week directed the FCC to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/departing-fcc-chair-rejects-complaints-about-tv-news-coverage-of-trump/">dismiss the complaints</a> against CBS, ABC, and NBC stations, along with a fourth complaint about Fox, in what she called a stand for the First Amendment. Rosenworcel said the "threat to the First Amendment has taken on new forms, as the incoming President has called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke licenses for broadcast television stations because he disagrees with their content and coverage."</p>
<p>But in three orders issued yesterday, the FCC Enforcement Bureau reversed the CBS, ABC, and NBC decisions. "We find that the previous order was issued prematurely based on an insufficient investigatory record for the station-specific conduct at issue," each new order said. "We therefore conclude that this complaint requires further consideration."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-fcc-chair-gets-to-work-on-punishing-news-stations-accused-of-bias/">Read full article</a></p>
