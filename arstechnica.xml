                            <![CDATA[<p>A prominent voice in the Make America Healthy Again movement is pushing for health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to make the topic of chemtrail conspiracy theories a federal priority, according to a report by KFF News.</p>
<p><a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/MAHA-Memo-Armour-Delany-Means.pdf">KFF obtained a memo</a>, written by MAHA influencer Gray Delany in July, presenting the topic to Calley Means, a White House health advisor. The memo lays out a series of unsubstantiated and far-fetched claims that academic researchers and federal agencies are secretively spreading toxic substances from airplanes, poisoning Americans and spurring large-scale weather events, such as the devastating flooding in Texas last summer.</p>
<p>“It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation’s citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany writes in the memo.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/rfk-jr-s-maha-wants-to-make-chemtrail-conspiracy-theories-great-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Like virtually every major Windows announcement in the last three years, the spate of features that Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/10/16/making-every-windows-11-pc-an-ai-pc/">announced for the operating system today</a> all revolve around generative AI. In particular, they’re concerned with the company’s more recent preoccupation with “agentic” AI, an industry buzzword for “telling AI-powered software to perform a task, which it then does in the background while you move on to other things.”</p>
<p>But the overarching impression I got, both from reading the announcement and sitting through a press briefing earlier this month, is that Microsoft is using language models and other generative AI technologies to try again with Cortana, Microsoft’s failed and discontinued entry in the voice assistant wars of the 2010s.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft’s Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi, “AI PCs” should be able to recognize input “naturally, in text or voice,” to be able to guide users based on what’s on their screens at any given moment, and that AI assistants “should be able to take action on your behalf.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsofts-vision-for-ai-pcs-looks-a-lot-like-another-crack-at-cortana/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hacking groups—at least one of which works on behalf of the North Korean government—have found a new and inexpensive way to distribute malware from “bulletproof” hosts: stashing them on public cryptocurrency blockchains.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/dprk-adopts-etherhiding/">Thursday post</a>, members of the Google Threat Intelligence Group said the technique provides the hackers with their own “bulletproof” host, a term that describes cloud platforms that are largely immune from takedowns by law enforcement and pressure from security researchers. More traditionally, these hosts are located in countries without treaties agreeing to enforce criminal laws from the US and other nations. These services often charge hefty sums and cater to criminals spreading malware or peddling child sexual abuse material and wares sold in crime-based flea markets.</p>
<h2>Next-gen, DIY hosting that can’t be tampered with</h2>
<p>Since February, Google researchers have observed two groups turning to a newer technique to infect targets with credential stealers and other forms of malware. The method, known as EtherHiding, embeds the malware in smart contracts, which are essentially apps that reside on blockchains for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Two or more parties then enter into an agreement spelled out in the contract. When certain conditions are met, the apps enforce the contract terms in a way that, at least theoretically, is immutable and independent of any central authority.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/hackers-bullet-proof-hosts-deliver-malware-from-blockchains/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday of last week, Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ars-live-is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-pop-ed-zitron-is-on-with-ars-at-330pm-edt-today/">hosted</a> a live conversation with Ed Zitron, host of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/better-offline/id1730587238">Better Offline</a> podcast and one of tech’s most vocal AI critics, to discuss whether the generative AI industry is experiencing a bubble and when it might burst. My Internet connection had other plans, though, dropping out multiple times and forcing Ars Technica’s Lee Hutchinson to jump in as an excellent emergency backup host.</p>
<p>During the times my connection cooperated, Zitron and I covered OpenAI’s financial issues, lofty infrastructure promises, and why the AI hype machine keeps rolling despite some arguably shaky economics underneath. Lee’s probing questions about per-user costs revealed a potential flaw in AI subscription models: Companies can’t predict whether a user will cost them $2 or $10,000 per month.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OnePlus is expected to take the wraps off the OnePlus 15 in the next few weeks, but before that, it’s giving us a look at the software that will run on it. OxygenOS 16, which is based on Android 16, will also come to the company’s other supported phones, and it’s going to include a heaping helping of AI features. OnePlus was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/oneplus-plans-huge-expansion-of-ai-features-on-its-phones-starting-with-13s/">slower than most</a> smartphone makers to embrace AI, but it’s full-steam ahead now with new Gemini integrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/oxygenos16">OxygenOS 16</a> is described by OnePlus in grandiose terms as “a defiant rebellion for authenticity.” In the real world, this update is doing a lot of the same things as other AI-heavy smartphones. It’s not <em>all </em>AI—OnePlus notes that OxygenOS 16 will include revamped animations that have been carefully designed for smoothness, as well as the O+ remote app that gives you remote access to Windows and Mac PCs. The lock screen is also more customizable, borrowing a page from the likes of Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>OnePlus began embracing AI in June, when it launched a feature called Mind Space on the OnePlus 13S. That phone was only for the Indian market, but the rest of the world will get this and more with OxygenOS 16. At launch, Mind Space would collect your screenshots and brief voice messages. Mind Space would analyze the screenshots to create calendar entries and not much else.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/oneplus-unveils-oxygenos-16-update-with-deep-gemini-integration/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Record labels Sony, Warner, and Universal yesterday asked the Supreme Court to help it boot pirates off the Internet.</p>
<p>Sony and the other labels filed their <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-171/379664/20251015121635831_24-171%20Sony%20Response%20Brief.pdf">brief</a> in <em>Cox Communications v. Sony Music Entertainment</em>, a case involving the cable Internet service provider that rebuffed labels’ demands for mass terminations of broadband subscribers accused of repeat copyright infringement. The Supreme Court’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/supreme-court-to-decide-whether-isps-must-disconnect-users-accused-of-piracy/">eventual decision in the case</a> may determine whether Internet service providers must terminate the accounts of alleged pirates in order to avoid massive financial liability.</p>
<p>Cox has <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-171/373201/20250829115733612_250829a%20Brief%20for%20efiling.pdf">argued</a> that copyright-infringement notices—which are generated by bots and flag users based on their IP addresses—sent by record labels are unreliable. Cox said ISPs can’t verify whether the notices are accurate and that terminating an account would punish every user in a household where only one person may have illegally downloaded copyrighted files.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/sony-tells-scotus-that-people-accused-of-piracy-arent-innocent-grandmothers/">Read full article</a></p>

With the upcoming bundle, people can subscribe to both for a total of $15/month or $20/month, depending on whether Peacock has ads or not (Apple TV never has ads).</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you’ve even idly checked in on the robust world of <em>Doom</em> fan development in recent years, you’ve probably encountered one of the hundreds of <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewforum.php?f=43">gameplay mods</a>, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:GZDoom_WADs">WAD files</a>, or <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/136771-every-gzdoom-game-on-steam/">entire commercial games</a> based on <em>GZDoom</em>. The <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom">open source <em>Doom</em> port</a>—which can trace its lineage back to the <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDoom_version_history/1.x#1.11_(March_6_1998)">original launch of <em>ZDoom</em> back in 1998</a>—adds modern graphics rendering, quality-of-life additions, and incredibly deep modding features to <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">the original <em>Doom</em> source code</a> that John Carmack released in 1997.</p>
<p>Now, though, the community behind <em>GZDoom</em> is publicly fracturing, with a large contingent of developers uniting behind a new fork <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom">called UZDoom</a>. The move is in apparent protest of the leadership of <em>GZDoom</em> creator and maintainer <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Christoph_Oelckers_(Graf_Zahl)">Cristoph Oelckers (aka Graf Zahl)</a>, who recently admitted to inserting untested AI-generated code into the <em>GZDoom</em> codebase.</p>
<p>“Due to some disagreements—some recent; some tolerated for close to 2 decades—with how collaboration should work, we’ve decided that the best course of action was to fork the project,” developer Nash Muhandes <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/155567-uzdoom/">wrote on the DoomWorld forums Wednesday</a>. “I don’t want to see the <em>GZDoom</em> legacy die, as do most all of us, hence why I think the best thing to do is to continue development through a fork, while introducing a different development model that highly favors transparent collaboration between multiple people.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/civil-war-gzdoom-fan-developers-split-off-over-use-of-chatgpt-generated-code/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the past week, OpenAI has faced backlash over subpoenas it sent to nonprofits accused of conspiring with Elon Musk to amplify public criticism of OpenAI as it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-scraps-controversial-plan-to-become-for-profit-after-mounting-pressure/">sought to shift from a nonprofit to for-profit structure.</a></p>
<p>The subpoenas are supposed to support OpenAI’s defense in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/openai-wouldnt-exist-without-me-elon-musk-says-reviving-lawsuit/">lawsuit Musk’s X Corp filed</a> to block the for-profit transition. Seeking a “wide variety of documents”—including a sweeping request for all communications regarding Musk and all information on nonprofits’ funders and donations—OpenAI claimed that the subpoenas are intended to probe if Musk was involved in the actions or paid nonprofits to make critical comments, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/openai-chatgpt-accused-using-subpoenas-silence-nonprofits-rcna237348">wrote</a> in a report exhaustively documenting the controversy.</p>
<p>But nonprofits have alleged it’s obvious that OpenAI is using the lawsuit to harass, silence, and intimidate its critics—most glaringly when it comes to targeting nonprofits that are even more publicly critical of Musk’s companies than they are of OpenAI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/openai-thinks-elon-musk-funded-its-biggest-critics-who-also-hate-musk/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Department of the Air Force has approved SpaceX’s plans to launch up to 100 missions per year from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.</p>
<p>This would continue the tectonic turnaround at the spaceport on California’s Central Coast. Five years ago, Vandenberg hosted just a single orbital launch. This year’s number stands at 51 orbital flights, or 53 launches if you count a pair of Minuteman missile tests, the most in a single calendar year at Vandenberg since the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Vandenberg is used for missions launching into polar orbits, paths oriented north-south that, over time, cover most of the Earth’s surface area. These orbits are popular for Earth observation satellites.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/spacex-has-plans-to-launch-falcon-heavy-from-california-if-anyone-wants-it-to/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As recently as the 1990s, when the Greenland Ice Sheet and the rest of the Arctic region were measurably thawing under the climatic blowtorch of human-caused global warming, most of Antarctica’s vast ice cap still seemed securely frozen.</p>
<p>But not anymore. Physics is physics. As the planet heats up, more ice will melt at both poles, and recent research shows that Antarctica’s ice caps, glaciers, and floating ice shelves, as well as its sea ice, are just as vulnerable to warming as the Arctic.</p>
<p>Both satellite data and field observations in Antarctica reveal alarming signs of a Greenland-like meltdown, with increased surface melting of the ice fields, faster-moving glaciers, and dwindling sea ice. Some scientists are sounding the alarm, warning that the rapid “Greenlandification” of Antarctica will have serious consequences, including an accelerated rise in sea levels and significant shifts in rainfall and drought patterns.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/antarctica-is-starting-to-look-a-lot-like-greenland-and-that-isnt-good/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We spoke with Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince about what exactly is going on here, why it matters, and what the web might soon look like. But to get into that, we need to cover a little background first.</p>
<p>The new change, which Cloudflare calls its <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-signals-policy/">Content Signals Policy</a>, happened after publishers and other companies that depend on web traffic have cried foul over Google’s AI Overviews and similar AI answer engines, saying they are sharply cutting those companies’ path to revenue because they don’t send traffic back to the source of the information.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/inside-the-web-infrastructure-revolt-over-googles-ai-overviews/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/seven-things-we-learned-from-openais-first-study-on-chatgpt-usage/">published a usage study</a> showing that nearly 15 percent of work-related conversations on ChatGPT had to deal with “making decisions and solving problems.” Now comes word that at least one high-level member of the US military is using LLMs for the same purpose.</p>
<p>At the Association of the US Army Conference in Washington, DC, this week, Maj. Gen. William “Hank” Taylor reportedly said that “Chat and I are really close lately,” using a distressingly familiar diminutive nickname to refer to an unspecified AI chatbot. “AI is one thing that, as a commander, it’s been very, very interesting for me.”</p>
<p>Military-focused news site DefenseScoop <a href="https://defensescoop.com/2025/10/13/eighth-army-commander-eyes-generative-ai-to-inform-how-he-leads/">reports</a> that Taylor told a roundtable group of reporters that he and <a href="https://8tharmy.korea.army.mil/site/index.asp">the Eighth Army</a> he commands out of South Korea are “regularly using” AI to modernize their <a href="https://www.amu.apus.edu/area-of-study/intelligence/resources/forecasting-threats/">predictive analysis</a> for logistical planning and operational purposes. That is helpful for paperwork tasks like “just being able to write our weekly reports and things,” Taylor said, but it also aids in informing their overall direction.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/army-general-says-hes-using-ai-to-improve-decision-making/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A stunning image of a rice weevil on a single grain of rice has won the 2025 Nikon Small World photomicrography contest, yielding valuable insight into the structure and behavior of—and providing a fresh perspective on—this well-known agricultural pest. The image was taken by Zhang You of Yunnan, China. Another of You’s photographs placed 15th in this year’s contest.</p>
<p>“It pays to dive deep into entomology: understanding insects’ behaviors and mastering lighting,” You said in a statement. “A standout work blends artistry with scientific rigor, capturing the very essence, energy, and spirit of these creatures.”</p>
<p>There was an element of luck in creating his winning image, too. “I had observed rice weevils in grains before, but never one with its wings spread,” You said. “This one was naturally preserved on a windowsill, perhaps in a final attempt to escape. Its tiny size makes manually preparing spread-wing specimens extremely difficult, so encountering it was both serendipitous and inspiring.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/meet-the-2025-nikon-photomicrography-winners/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>But now there are signs that the twain may, in the not too distant future, split.</p>
<p>This is because Lockheed Martin has begun to pivot toward a future in which the Orion spacecraft—thanks to increasing reusability, a focus on cost, and openness to flying on different rockets—fits into commercial space applications. In interviews, company officials said that if NASA wanted to buy Orion missions as a “service,” rather than owning and operating the spacecraft, they were ready to work with the space agency.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/once-unthinkable-nasa-and-lockheed-now-consider-launching-orion-on-other-rockets/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of networks—many of them operated by the US government and Fortune 500 companies—face an “imminent threat” of being breached by a nation-state hacking group following the breach of a major maker of software, the federal government warned Wednesday.</p>
<p>F5, a Seattle-based maker of networking software, <a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000154696">disclosed the breach</a> on Wednesday. F5 said a “sophisticated” threat group working for an undisclosed nation-state government had surreptitiously and persistently dwelled in its network over a “long-term.” Security researchers who have responded to similar intrusions in the past took the language to mean the hackers were inside the F5 network <a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/115378445416288653">for years</a>.</p>
<h2>Unprecedented</h2>
<p>During that time, F5 said, the hackers took control of the network segment the company uses to create and distribute updates for BIG IP, a line of server appliances that F5 <a href="https://www.f5.com/c/emea-2020/event/f5-myforum">says</a> is used by 48 of the world’s top 50 corporations. Wednesday’s disclosure went on to say the threat group downloaded proprietary BIG-IP source code information about vulnerabilities that had been privately discovered but not yet patched. The hackers also obtained configuration settings that some customers used inside their networks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/breach-of-f5-requires-emergency-action-from-big-ip-users-feds-warn/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In separate press briefings on Tuesday, a network of terminated CDC staff that goes by the name the National Public Health Coalition, and the union representing employees at the agency discussed what the wide-scale cuts mean for the American people, as well as the trauma, despair, and damage they have wreaked on the workers of the once-premier public health agency.</p>
<p>In a normal federal layoff—called a reduction in force, or RIF—the agency would be given a full outline of the roles and branches or divisions affected, as well as some explanation for the cuts, such as alleged fraud, abuse, or redundancy. However, the Trump administration has provided no such information or explanation, leaving current and former employees to essentially crowdsource what has been lost and only guess at the possible reasons.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/cdc-tormented-hr-workers-summoned-from-furlough-to-lay-off-themselves-others/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5">released</a> Claude Haiku 4.5, a small AI language model that reportedly delivers performance similar to what its frontier model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Claude Sonnet 4</a> achieved five months ago but at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed. The new model is available now to all Claude app, web, and API users.</p>
<p>If the benchmarks for Haiku 4.5 reported by Anthropic hold up to independent testing, the fact that the company can match some capabilities of its cutting-edge coding model from only five months ago (and GPT-5 in coding) while providing a dramatic speed increase and cost cut is notable.</p>
<p>As a recap, Anthropic ships the Claude family in three model sizes: Haiku (small), Sonnet (medium), and Opus (large). The larger models are based on larger neural networks and typically include deeper contextual knowledge but are slower and more expensive to run. Due to a technique called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-firms-follow-deepseeks-lead-create-cheaper-models-with-distillation/">distillation</a>, companies like Anthropic have been able to craft smaller AI models that match the capability of larger, older models at functional tasks like coding, although it typically comes at the cost of omitting stored knowledge.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/anthropics-claude-haiku-4-5-matches-mays-frontier-model-at-fraction-of-cost/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Rejecting opposition from the cable and real estate industries, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that aims to increase broadband competition in apartment buildings.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB1414/2025">new law</a> taking effect on January 1 says landlords must let tenants “opt out of paying for any subscription from a third-party Internet service provider, such as through a bulk-billing arrangement, to provide service for wired Internet, cellular, or satellite service that is offered in connection with the tenancy.” It was approved by the state Assembly in a 75–0 vote in April, and by the Senate in a 30–7 vote last month.</p>
<p>“This is kind of like a first step in trying to give this industry an opportunity to just treat people fairly,” Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom, a Democratic lawmaker who authored the bill, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/california-snubs-cable-lobby-with-bill-to-boost-isp-competition-in-rental-housing/">told Ars last month</a>. “It’s not super restrictive. We are not banning bulk billing. We’re not even limiting how much money the people can make. What we’re saying here with this bill is that if a tenant wants to opt out of the arrangement, they should be allowed to opt out.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/california-says-landlords-cant-make-tenants-pay-for-an-isp-they-dont-want/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>More than half of American car buyers would consider a Chinese car brand for their next purchase, an increase of almost 25 percent compared to last year. That’s according to a survey of prospective car buyers conducted annually by the research firm AutoPacific. And yes, those car buyers are conscious of the privacy and security fears.</p>
<p>AutoPacific spoke to 18,000 people who said they were planning to buy or lease a new car within the next three years for its 2025 Future Attribution Demand Study, and the company has been releasing snippets of data as it analyzes them, ahead of the full report’s release later this year.</p>
<p>There has already been at least one surprise. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/from-rain-sensors-to-wireless-charging-the-10-tech-features-car-buyers-want/">Last year</a>, partially automated driving systems like General Motors’ Super Cruise or Ford’s BlueCruise, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/tesla-loses-autopilot-wrongful-death-case-in-329-million-verdict/">those developed by Tesla</a>, were not in high demand. This year, that tech went to the top of the most-wanted list, with 43 percent of consumers saying they want hands-free partial automation. The same percentage also indicated a demand for rear automatic emergency braking. Wireless device charging, No. 1 in the list in 2024, didn’t make the top 15 for 2025.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/us-demand-grows-for-chinese-cars-despite-privacy-and-security-fears/">Read full article</a></p>
