<p>Some time next year, NASA believes SpaceX will be ready to link two Starships in orbit for an ambitious refueling demonstration, a technical feat that will put the Moon within reach.</p>
<p>SpaceX is under contract with NASA to supply two human-rated Starships for the first two astronaut landings on the Moon through the agency's Artemis program, which aims to return people to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. The first of these landings, on NASA's Artemis III mission, is currently targeted for 2026, although this is widely viewed as an ambitious schedule.</p>
<p>Last year, NASA awarded a contract to Blue Origin to develop its own human-rated Blue Moon lunar lander, giving Artemis managers two options for follow-on missions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020606#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020606&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On March 16, cows on a Texas dairy farm began showing symptoms of a mysterious illness now known to be H5N1 bird flu. Their symptoms were nondescript, but their milk production dramatically dropped and turned thick and creamy yellow. The next day, cats on the farm that had consumed some of the raw milk from the sick cows also became ill. While the cows would go on to largely recover, the cats weren't so lucky. They developed depressed mental states, stiff body movements, loss of coordination, circling, copious discharge from their eyes and noses, and blindness. By March 20, over half of the farm's 24 or so cats died from the flu.</p>
<p>In a study published today in <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/7/24-0508_article">the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases</a>, researchers in Iowa, Texas, and Kansas found that the cats had H5N1 not just in their lungs but also in their brains, hearts, and eyes. The findings are similar to those seen <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592682/pdf/JPATH168000176.pdf">in cats that were experimentally infected with H5N1</a>, aka highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI). But, on the Texas dairy farm, they present an ominous warning of the potential for transmission of this dangerous and evolving virus.</p>
<p>The contaminated milk was the most likely source of the cat's fatal infections, the study authors concluded. Although it can't be entirely ruled out that the cats got sick from eating infected wild birds, the milk they drank from the sick cows was brimming with virus particles, and genetic data shows almost exact matches between the cows, their milk, and the cats. "Therefore, our findings suggest cross-species mammal-to-mammal transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus and raise new concerns regarding the potential for virus spread within mammal populations," wrote the authors, who are veterinary researchers from Iowa, Texas, and Kansas.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020641#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020641&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Roku CEO Anthony Wood disclosed plans to introduce video ads to the Roku OS home screen. The news highlights Roku’s growing focus on advertising and an alarming trend in the streaming industry that sees ads increasingly forced on viewers.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/roku-wants-to-use-home-screen-to-new-types-of-ads-to-customers-while-also-improving-content-discovery">The Streamable</a>, during Roku's Q1 2024 earnings call last week, Wood, also the company's founder and chairman, boasted about the Roku OS home screen showing users ads "before they select an app," avoiding the possibility that they don't see any ads during their TV-viewing session. (The user might only use Roku to access a video streaming app for which they have an ad-free subscription.)</p>
<p>Wood also noted future plans to make the Roku home screen even more ad-laden:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020463#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020463&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For those eagerly anticipating the second season of Netflix's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-netflixs-exquisite-the-sandman-is-the-stuff-dreams-are-made-of/">stellar adaption</a> of Neil Gaiman's <em>Sandman</em> graphic novels, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Boy_Detectives_(TV_series)"><em>Dead Boy Detectives</em></a>—the streaming plaform's new supernatural horror detective series—is a welcome return to that weird magical world. Co-showrunner Steve Yockey (<em>Supernatural</em>), who created the series, aptly describes it as "the <em>Hardy Boys</em> on acid." You've got vengeful witches, demons, psychic mediums, cursed masks, foul-mouthed parasitic sprites, talking cats—and, of course, the titular ghostly detectives, intent on spending their afterlife cracking all manner of mysterious paranormal cases.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(comic_book)">Sandman</a></em> fans first encountered the Dead Boys in the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman:_Season_of_Mists">Seasons of Mist</a>" storyline, in which the ghost Edwin Paine and Charles Rowland meet for the first time in 1990. Edwin had been murdered at his boarding school in 1916 and spent decades in Hell. When Lucifer abandoned his domain, Hell was emptied, and Edwin was among the souls who returned to that boarding school. Charles was a living student whom Edwin tried to protect. Charles ultimately died and chose to join Edwin in his afterlife adventures. The characters reappeared in the <em>Children's Crusade</em> crossover series, in which they decided to become detectives.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019722#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019722&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Friday, the US Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/04/26/over-20-technology-and-critical-infrastructure-executives-civil-rights-leaders">announced</a> the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board that consists of 22 members pulled from the tech industry, government, academia, and civil rights organizations. But given the nebulous nature of the term "AI," which can apply to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">broad spectrum</a> of computer technology, it's unclear if this group will even be able to agree on what exactly they are safeguarding us from.</p>

<p>President Biden directed DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to establish the board, which will meet for the first time in early May and subsequently on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>The fundamental assumption posed by the board's existence, and reflected in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/biden-ai-executive-order-requires-safety-testing-for-ai-that-poses-serious-risk/">Biden's AI executive order from October</a>, is that AI is an inherently risky technology and that American citizens and businesses need to be protected from its misuse. Along those lines, the goal of the group is to help guard against foreign adversaries using AI to disrupt US infrastructure; develop recommendations to ensure the safe adoption of AI tech into transportation, energy, and Internet services; foster cross-sector collaboration between government and businesses; and create a forum where AI leaders to share information on AI security risks with the DHS.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020418#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020418&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Starting in March with the release of iOS 17.4, iPhones in the European Union have been subject to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), a batch of regulations that (among other things) forced Apple to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">support alternate app stores</a>, app sideloading, and third-party browser engines in iOS for the first time. Today, EU regulators announced that they are also categorizing Apple's iPadOS as a "gatekeeper," meaning that the iPad will soon be subject to the same regulations as the iPhone.</p>

<p>The EU began investigating whether iPadOS would qualify as a gatekeeper in September 2023, the same day it decided that iOS, the Safari browser, and the App Store were all gatekeepers.</p>
<p>"Apple now has six months to ensure full compliance of iPadOS with the DMA obligations," <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2363">reads</a> the EU's blog post about the change.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020496#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020496&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission today said it fined T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon $196 million "for illegally sharing access to customers' location information without consent and without taking reasonable measures to protect that information against unauthorized disclosure."</p>
<p>The fines relate to sharing of real-time location data that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/verizon-and-att-will-stop-selling-your-phones-location-to-data-brokers/">revealed in 2018</a>.

<p>If you build a gadget that connects to the Internet and sell it in the United Kingdom, you can no longer make the default password "password." In fact, you're not supposed to have default passwords at all.</p>
<p>A new version of the 2022 <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/46">Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act</a> (PTSI) is now in effect, covering just about everything that a consumer can buy that connects to the web. Under <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf">the guidelines</a>, even the tiniest Wi-Fi board must either have a randomized password or else generate a password upon initialization (through a smartphone app or other means). This password can't be incremental ("password1," "password54"), and it can't be "related in an obvious way to public information," such as MAC addresses or Wi-Fi network names. A device should be sufficiently strong against brute-force access attacks, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing">credential stuffing</a>, and should have a "simple mechanism" for changing the password.</p>
<p>There's more, and it's just as head-noddingly obvious. Software components, where reasonable, "should be securely updateable," should actually check for updates, and should update either automatically or in a way "simple for the user to apply." Perhaps most importantly, device owners can report security issues and expect to hear back about how that report is being handled.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020491#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020491&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Authentication service Okta is warning about the “unprecedented scale” of an ongoing campaign that routes fraudulent login requests through the mobile devices and browsers of everyday users in an attempt to conceal the malicious behavior.</p>
<p>The attack, Okta said, uses other means to camouflage the login attempts as well, including the TOR network and so-called proxy services from providers such as NSOCKS, Luminati, and DataImpulse, which can also harness users’ devices without their knowledge. In some cases, the affected mobile devices are running malicious apps. In other cases, users have enrolled their devices in proxy services in exchange for various incentives.</p>
<p>Unidentified adversaries then use these devices in credential-stuffing attacks, which use large lists of login credentials obtained from previous data breaches in an attempt to access online accounts. Because the requests come from IP addresses and devices with good reputations, network security devices don’t give them the same level of scrutiny as logins from virtual private servers (VPS) that come from hosting services threat actors have used for years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020513#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020513&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Give the AI access to your credit card, they said. It'll be <em>fine</em>, they said. Users of Meta's ad platform who followed that advice have been getting burned by an AI-powered ad purchasing system, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/28/24141585/meta-ai-advantage-plus-automated-ad-glitch-cpm">The Verge</a>. The idea was to use a Meta-developed AI to automatically set up ads and spend your ad budget, saving you the hassle of making decisions about your ad campaign. Apparently, the AI funnels money to Meta a little too well: Customers say it burns, though, what should be daily ad budgets in a matter of hours, and costs are inflated as much as 10-fold.</p>
<p>The AI-powered software in question is the "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1362234537597370">Advantage+ Shopping Campaign</a>." The system is supposed to automate a lot of ad setup for you, mixing and matching various creative elements and audience targets. The power of AI-powered advertising (Google has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/report-google-ads-restructure-could-replace-some-sales-jobs-with-ai/">similar product</a>) is that the ad platform can get instant feedback on its generated ads via click-through rates. You give it a few guard rails, and it can try hundreds or thousands of combinations to find the most clickable ad at a speed and efficiency no human could match. That's the theory, anyway.</p>
<p>The Verge spoke to "several marketers and businesses" with similar stories of being hit by an AI-powered spending spree once they let Meta's system take over a campaign. The description of one account says the AI "had blown through roughly 75 percent of the daily ad budgets for both clients in under a couple of hours" and that "the ads’ CPMs, or cost per impressions, were roughly 10 times higher than normal." Meanwhile, the revenue earned from those AI-powered ads was "nearly zero." The report says, "Small businesses have seen their ad dollars get wiped out and wasted as a result, and some have said the bouts of overspending are driving them from Meta’s platforms."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020445#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020445&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this month, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-is-investigating-game-crashes-on-top-end-core-i9-desktop-cpus/">wrote</a> that some of Intel's recent high-end Core i9 and Core i7 processors had been crashing and exhibiting other weird issues in some games and that Intel was investigating the cause.</p>
<p>An Intel statement <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-releases-the-13th-and-14th-generation-k-sku-processor-instability-issue-update/">obtained by Igor's Lab</a> suggests that Intel's investigation is wrapping up, and the company is pointing squarely in the direction of enthusiast motherboard makers that are turning up power limits and disabling safeguards to try to wring a little more performance out of the processors.</p>
<p>"While the root cause has not yet been identified, Intel has observed the majority of reports of this issue are from users with unlocked/overclock capable motherboards," the statement reads. "Intel has observed 600/700 Series chipset boards often set BIOS defaults to disable thermal and power delivery safeguards designed to limit processor exposure to sustained periods of high voltage and frequency."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020417#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020417&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Supreme Court today rejected Elon Musk's attempt to terminate his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/musk-asks-supreme-court-to-toss-sec-settlement-claims-free-speech-violation/">appealed to the Supreme Court</a> in December 2023, claiming the settlement he agreed to in 2018 forced him to "waive his First Amendment rights to speak on matters ranging far beyond the charged violations." The SEC settlement <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.501755/gov.uscourts.nysd.501755.47.0.pdf">requires</a> Musk to get pre-approval from a Tesla securities lawyer for tweets or other social media posts that may contain information material to the company or its shareholders.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court decided not to hear the case, leaving an appeals court ruling against Musk intact.

<p>Thus far, Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/will-nintendos-switch-successor-be-backward-compatible/">offered only vague hints</a> regarding whether or not the upcoming Switch 2 will run games and software designed for the current Switch. Now, an obscure Chinese peripheral maker is reporting that the new console will indeed work with existing physical Switch game cards and digital Switch game downloads.</p>
<p>The new report comes from <a href="https://www.mobapad.com/">MobaPad</a>, a little-known creator of Switch controllers and carrying cases based in Shenzen, China. In <a href="https://www.mobapad.com/blogs/the-latest-scoop-on-nintendo-switch-2/the-latest-scoop-on-nintendo-switch-2">a Sunday morning blog post</a>, the company says it is "in the process of developing the next-generation console controller" for the Switch 2 and has "acquired a lot of first-hand information" about the console as a result (MobaPad shared similar insights days earlier on <a href="https://www-bilibili-com.translate.goog/opus/925030436838572049?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Chinese video site Bilibili</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ceajbf/switch_2_switch_attach_details_leaked_by_3rd/">briefly on its English Facebook page</a>).</p>
<p>Chief among MobaPad's purported revelations is that "the cartridge slot of the Switch 2 will support backward compatibility with physical Switch game cartridges, ensuring compatibility with players' existing game libraries, including digital versions." Game cards designed specifically for the Switch 2, on the other hand, "may not be compatible with the first-generation console," suggesting there may be a physical change preventing Switch 2 game cards from being accidentally inserted into an older Switch console.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020421#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The federal regulator responsible for road safety has opened yet another probe into the safety of a hands-free driver assistance system, we learned this morning. And no, it's not a system from Tesla. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation has opened a <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2024/INOA-PE24012-12041.pdf">preliminary investigation</a> into Ford's BlueCruise system, following a pair of fatal crashes, both of which occurred at night.</p>
<p>Ford <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/ford-will-roll-out-bluecruise-hands-free-driving-software-in-q3-2021/">introduced BlueCruise in 2021</a>. Like the similar General Motors Super Cruise, but unlike Tesla Autopilot, BlueCruise has been designed with a tightly controlled operational design domain (ODD) that only allows it to be engaged on restricted access, divided lane highways that have been lidar-mapped in advance.</p>
<p>Additionally, like Super Cruise but unlike Tesla's far more dangerous system, there is an infrared gaze-tracking driver monitoring camera that will disengage the system if it determines the driver is not paying attention to the road.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020402#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020402&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brussels is set to open a probe into Meta’s Facebook and Instagram as soon as Monday over concerns the social media giant is failing to do enough to counter disinformation from Russia and other countries.</p>
<p>Regulators suspect that Meta’s moderation does not go far enough to stop the widespread dissemination of political advertising that risks undermining the electoral process, the European Commission is expected to say on Monday, two people with knowledge of the matter said.</p>
<p>EU officials are particularly worried about the way Meta’s platforms are handling Russia’s efforts to undermine upcoming European elections. The commission, however, is not expected to single out Russia in its statement and will only make reference to the manipulation of information by foreign actors.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020406#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020406&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>People have been leaving public messages since the first artists painted hunting scenes on cave walls. But it was the invention of electricity that forever changed the way we talked to each other. In 1844, the first message was sent via telegraph. Samuel Morse, who created the binary Morse Code decades before electronic computers were even possible, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/samuel-morse-papers/articles-and-essays/invention-of-the-telegraph/">tapped out</a>, “What hath God wrought?” It was a prophetic first post.</p>
<p>World War II accelerated the invention of digital computers, but they were primarily single-use machines, designed to calculate artillery firing tables or solve scientific problems. As computers got more powerful, the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing">time-sharing</a> became attractive. Computers were expensive, and they spent most of their time idle, waiting for a user to enter keystrokes at a terminal. Time-sharing allowed many people to interact with a single computer at the same time.</p>
<h2>Part 0: The Precambrian era of digital communication (1969–1979)</h2>
<p>Soon after time-sharing was invented, people started sending messages to other users. But since every computer spoke its own unique machine language and had its own way of storing and retrieving data, none of these machines could talk to each other. The solution to this problem came out of the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), and was thus dubbed the “ARPANET.” When two different computers connected to each other through an “IMP” (Interface Message Processor, the first router) in 1969, it was a massive <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0684832674/?tag=arstech20-20">breakthrough</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017574#p3">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017574&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Shrubbery, toolsheds, basements—these are places one might expect to find spiders. But what about the beach? Or in a stream? Some <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2023/everyone-should-start-counting-spiders">spiders</a> make their homes near or, more rarely, in water: tucking into the base of kelp stalks, spinning watertight cocoons in ponds or lakes, hiding under pebbles at the seaside or creek bank.</p>
<p>“Spiders are surprisingly adaptable, which is one of the reasons they can inhabit this environment,” says Ximena Nelson, a behavioral biologist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>

<p>One year ago, Germany took its last three nuclear power stations offline. When it comes to energy, few events have baffled outsiders more.</p>
<p>In the face of climate change, calls to expedite the transition away from fossil fuels, and an energy crisis precipitated by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Berlin’s move to quit nuclear before carbon-intensive energy sources like coal has attracted significant criticism. (Greta Thunberg prominently labeled it “a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/greta-thunberg-germany-making-mistake-by-ditching-nuclear-power-for-coal/a-63406732#:%7E:text=Climate%20activist%20Greta%20Thunberg%20told,coal%20instead%20to%20generate%20electricity">mistake</a>.”)</p>
<p>This decision can only be understood in the context of post-war socio-political developments in Germany, where anti-nuclearism predated the public climate discourse.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020372#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020372&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/war-never-changes-a-fallout-fans-spoiler-laden-review-of-the-new-tv-series/">War never changes</a>, but <em>Fallout 76</em> sure has. The online game that launched to a negative reception with no NPCs but plenty of bugs has mutated in new directions since its 2018 debut. Now it’s finding new life thanks to the wildly popular <em>Fallout</em> TV series that debuted a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>In truth, it never died, though it has stayed in decidedly niche territory for the past six years. Developer Bethesda Game Studios has released regular updates fixing (many of) the bugs, adding new ways to play, softening the game’s rough edges, and yes, introducing <em>Fallout 3-</em> or <em>Fallout 4</em>-like, character-driven quest lines with fully voiced NPCs—something many players felt was missing in the early days.</p>
<p>It’s still not for everybody, but for a select few of us who’ve stuck with it, there’s nothing else quite like it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019560#p3">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019560&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>NASA officials declared the Artemis I mission successful in late 2021, and it's hard to argue with that assessment. The Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft performed nearly flawlessly on an unpiloted flight that took it around the Moon and back to Earth, setting the stage for the Artemis II, the program's first crew mission.</p>
<p>But one of the things engineers saw on Artemis I that didn't quite match expectations was an issue with the Orion spacecraft's heat shield. As the capsule streaked back into Earth's atmosphere at the end of the mission, the heat shield ablated, or burned off, in a different manner than predicted by computer models.</p>
<p>More of the charred material than expected came off the heat shield during the Artemis I reentry, and the way it came off was somewhat uneven, NASA officials said. Orion's heat shield is made of a material called Avcoat, which is designed to burn off as the spacecraft plunges into the atmosphere at 25,000 mph (40,000 km per hour). Coming back from the Moon, Orion encountered temperatures up to 5,000° Fahrenheit (2,760° Celsius), hotter than a spacecraft sees when it reenters the atmosphere from low-Earth orbit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020378#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020378&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
