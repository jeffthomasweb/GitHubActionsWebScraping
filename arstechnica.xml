              <![CDATA[<p>It's well-established that, on the whole, Americans die younger than people in most other high-income countries. For instance, <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/americans-no-matter-state-they-live-die-younger-people-many-other-countries">an analysis from 2022</a> found that the average life expectancy of someone born in Switzerland or Spain in 2019 was 84 years. Meanwhile, the average US life expectancy was 78.8, lower than nearly all other high-income countries, including Canada's, which was 82.3 years. And this was before the pandemic, which <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-life-expectancy-falls-lowest-levels-1996-due/story?id=95649464">only made things worse</a> for the US.</p>
<p>Perhaps some Americans may think that this lower overall life-expectancy doesn't really apply to them if they're middle- or upper-class. After all, wealth inequality and health disparities are huge problems in the US. Those with more money simply have better access to health care and better health outcomes. Well-off Americans live longer, with lifespans on par with their peers in high-income countries, some may think.</p>
<p>It is true that money buys you a longer life in the US. In fact, the link between wealth and mortality may be stronger in the US than in any other high-income country. But, if you think American wealth will put life expectancy in league with Switzerland, you're dead wrong, according to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa2408259">a study in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/wealthy-americans-have-death-rates-on-par-with-poor-europeans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As AI hype permeates the Internet, tech and business leaders are already looking toward the next step. AGI, or artificial general intelligence, refers to a machine with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-general-intelligence/">human-like intelligence and capabilities</a>. If today's AI systems are on a path to AGI, we will need new approaches to ensure such a machine doesn't work against human interests.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have anything as elegant as Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. Researchers at DeepMind have been working on this problem and have released a <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/evaluating-potential-cybersecurity-threats-of-advanced-ai/An_Approach_to_Technical_AGI_Safety_Apr_2025.pdf">new technical paper</a> (PDF) that explains how to develop AGI safely, which you can download at your convenience.</p>
<p>It contains a huge amount of detail, clocking in at 108 pages <em>before</em> references. While some in the AI field believe AGI is a pipe dream, the authors of the DeepMind paper project that it could happen by 2030. With that in mind, they aimed to understand the risks of a human-like synthetic intelligence, which they acknowledge could lead to "severe harm."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/google-deepmind-releases-its-plan-to-keep-agi-from-running-wild/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When Google announced Tuesday that end-to-end encrypted messages were coming to Gmail for business users, some people balked, noting it wasn’t true E2EE as the term is known in privacy and security circles. Others wondered precisely how it works under the hood. Here’s a description of what the new service does and doesn’t do, as well as some of the basic security that underpins it.</p>
<p>When Google uses the term E2EE in this context, it means that an email is encrypted inside Chrome, Firefox, or just about any other browser the sender chooses. As the message makes its way to its destination, it remains encrypted and can’t be decrypted until it arrives at its final destination, when it’s decrypted in the recipient's browser.</p>
<h2>Giving S/MIME the heave-ho</h2>
<p>The chief selling point of this new service is that it allows government agencies and the businesses that work with them to comply with a raft of security and privacy regulations and at the same time eliminates the massive headaches that have traditionally plagued anyone deploying such regulation-compliant email systems. Up to now, the most common means has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME">S/MIME</a>, a standard so complex and painful that only the bravest and most well-resourced organizations tend to implement it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/are-new-google-e2ee-emails-really-end-to-end-encrypted-kinda-but-not-really/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Bonobos, great apes related to us and chimpanzees that live in the Republic of Congo, communicate with vocal calls including peeps, hoots, yelps, grunts, and whistles. Now, a team of Swiss scientists led by Melissa Berthet, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Zurich, discovered bonobos can combine these basic sounds into larger semantic structures. In these communications, meaning is something more than just a sum of individual calls—a trait known as non-trivial compositionality, which we once thought was uniquely human.</p>
<p>To do this, Berthet and her colleagues built a database of 700 bonobo calls and deciphered them using methods drawn from distributional semantics, the methodology we’ve relied on in reconstructing long-lost languages like Etruscan or Rongorongo. For the first time, we have a glimpse into what bonobos mean when they call to each other in the wild.</p>
<h2>Context is everything</h2>
<p>The key idea behind distributional semantics is that when words appear in similar contexts, they tend to have similar meanings. To decipher an unknown language, you need to collect a large corpus of words and turn those words into vectors—mathematical representations that let you place them in a multidimensional semantic space. The second thing you need is context data, which tells you the circumstances in which these words were used (that gets vectorized, too). When you map your word vectors onto context vectors in this multidimensional space, what usually happens is that words with similar meaning end up close to each other. Berthet and her colleagues wanted to apply the same trick to bonobos’ calls. That seemed straightforward at first glance, but proved painfully hard to execute.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/bonobos-calls-may-be-the-closest-thing-to-animal-language-weve-seen/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">Switch 2 reveal</a>, neither Nintendo nor Nvidia has gone into any detail at all about the exact chip inside the upcoming handheld—technically, we are still not sure what Arm CPU architecture or what GPU architecture it uses, how much RAM we can expect it to have, how fast that memory will be, or exactly how many graphics cores we're looking at.</p>
<p>But interviews with Nintendo executives and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/">a blog post from Nvidia</a> did at least confirm several of the new chip's capabilities. The "custom Nvidia processor" has a GPU "with dedicated [Ray-Tracing] Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements," writes Nvidia Software Engineering VP Muni Anda.</p>
<p>This means that, as rumored, the Switch 2 will support Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscaling technology, which helps to upscale a lower-resolution image into a higher-resolution image with less of a performance impact than native rendering and less loss of quality than traditional upscaling methods. For the Switch games that can render at 4K or at 120 FPS 1080p, DLSS will likely be responsible for making it possible.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-confirms-the-switch-2-supports-dlss-g-sync-and-ray-tracing/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Voice breaks in Latin American monkey calls resemble human yodeling, but over a much wider frequency range.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Humans have practiced some form of yodeling since at least the 13th century, when Marco Polo encountered Tibetan monks on his travels who used the vocal technique for long-distance communication. It's since morphed into a distinctive singing style. But can animals also yodel? According to a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2024.0005">new paper</a> published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, Biological Sciences, several species of monkey dwelling in the rainforests of Latin America employ "voice breaks" in their calls that acoustically resemble human yodeling—i.e., "ultra-yodels" that boast a much wider frequency range.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626352-300-mechanical-mysteries-of-the-yodel/">wrote about</a> the bioacoustics of human yodeling for New Scientist. In many respects, yodeling is quite simple. It merely involves singing a long note subjected to repeated rapid sharp shifts in pitch. It's the unique anatomy of the human vocal tract that makes it possible, notably the larynx (voice box) located just behind the Adam's apple. The larynx is comprised of cartilage and the hyoid bone that together support the vocal cords, which are attached to muscles on either side of the larynx.</p>
<p>When air flows through the trachea, the vocal cords vibrate at frequencies ranging from 110 to 200 Hz. We have the capability of contracting the muscles to change the shape, position, and tension of our vocal cords, thereby altering the pitch of the sound produced. Stiffer vocal cords result in faster vibrations, which produce higher pitches.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/monkeys-are-better-yodelers-than-humans-study-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Critics are questioning if Donald Trump's administration possibly used chatbots to calculate reciprocal tariffs <a href="ttps://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/">announced</a> yesterday that Trump claimed were "individualized" tariffs placed on countries that have " the largest trade deficits" with the US.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Those tariffs are due to take effect on April 9 for 60 countries, with peak rates around 50 percent. That's in addition to a baseline 10 percent tariff that all countries will be subject to starting on April 5. But while Trump expressed intent to push back on anyone supposedly taking advantage of the US, some of the countries on the reciprocal tariffs list puzzled experts and officials, who pointed out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-tariffs-antarctica-uninhabited-heard-mcdonald-islands">to The Guardian</a> that Trump was, for some reason, targeting uninhabited islands, some of them exporting nothing and populated with penguins.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some overseas officials challenged Trump's math, such as George Plant, the administrator of Norfolk Island, who told the Guardian that "there are no known exports from Norfolk Island to the United States and no tariffs or known non-tariff trade barriers on goods coming to Norfolk Island."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX is having trouble with Starship's upper stage after back-to-back failures, but engineers are making remarkable progress with the rocket's enormous booster.</p>
<p>The most visible sign of SpaceX making headway with Starship's first stage<span class="s1">—c</span>alled Super Heavy<span class="s1">—</span>came at 9:40 am local time (10:40 am EDT; 14:40 UTC) Thursday at the company's Starbase launch site in South Texas.

              <![CDATA[<p>Most of Google's AI efforts thus far have involved adding generative features to existing products, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-new-notebooklm-app-builds-a-custom-ai-based-on-a-source-document/">NotebookLM is different</a>. Created by the Google Labs team, NotebookLM uses AI to analyze user-provided documents. Starting today, it will be even easier to use NotebookLM to explore topics, as Google has added a "Discover Sources" feature to let the app look up its own sources.</p>
<p>Previously, to create a new notebook, you had to feed the AI documents, web links, YouTube videos, or raw text. You can still do that, but you don't have to with the addition of Discover functionality. Simply click the new button and tell <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">NotebookLM</a> what you're interested in learning. Google says the app will consider "hundreds of potential web sources" in the blink of an eye, giving you the top 10 from which to choose. There will be links available so you can peruse the suggestions before adding them to the model.</p>
<p>The sources you select will be ingested as if they were documents you uploaded, creating a conversant AI for your chosen topic. The content of those sources will also be loaded into NotebookLM so you can refer to them directly. That's not why you use NotebookLM, though. You use NotebookLM for all the nifty AI-assisted features.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/google-gives-notebooklm-a-discover-button-to-search-the-web/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>New <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/">25 percent tariffs on all foreign car imports</a> into the United States went into effect this week as President Trump ignited his new trade war. It has caused something of a rush at dealerships around the country as customers descend on existing stock in an attempt to beat <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/trump-on-car-tariffs-i-couldnt-care-less-if-they-raise-prices/">looming price increases</a> of thousands of dollars. Now we're starting to see how the automakers are reacting.</p>
<h2>Employee pricing for all</h2>
<p>Ford is in the rather enviable position of having the least exposure to the new vehicle tariff than all but Tesla; less than 20 percent of the cars, trucks, and SUVs that Ford sells in the US are imported from abroad. And it will lean into that with a new ad campaign with the slogan "From America, For America," which launches today. (Note that this does not take into account the separate parts tariff that goes into effect before May 2.)</p>
<p>Never mind the slogan, though. The campaign extends Ford's "A plan" pricing, which in plain English is its employee discount, to all its customers. The blue oval is offering A plan pricing on most 2024 and 2025 vehicles, including the all-electric F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, as well as its various hybrids.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/how-automakers-like-ford-vw-stellantis-are-reacting-to-trumps-25-tariff/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US experts who work in artificial intelligence fields seem to have a much rosier outlook on AI than the rest of us.</p>
<p>In a survey comparing views of a nationally representative sample (5,410) of the general public to a sample of 1,013 AI experts, the Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/">found</a> that "experts are far more positive and enthusiastic about AI than the public" and "far more likely than Americans overall to believe AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States over the next 20 years" (56 percent vs. 17 percent). And perhaps most glaringly, 76 percent of experts believe these technologies will benefit them personally rather than harm them (15 percent).</p>
<p>The public does not share this confidence. Only about 11 percent of the public says that "they are more excited than concerned about the increased use of AI in daily life." They're much more likely (51 percent) to say they're more concerned than excited, whereas only 15 percent of experts shared that pessimism. Unlike the majority of experts, just 24 percent of the public thinks AI will be good for them, whereas nearly half the public anticipates they will be personally harmed by AI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/survey-americans-fear-ai-will-hurt-them-experts-expect-the-opposite/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[The study shows a sharp change when the vaccine was introduced in Wales.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A study released on Wednesday finds that a live-virus vaccine that limits shingles symptoms was associated with a drop in the risk for dementia when it was introduced. The work took advantage of the fact that the National Health Service Wales made the vaccine available with a very specific age limit, essentially creating two populations, vaccinated and unvaccinated, separated by a single date. And these populations showed a sharp divide in how often they were diagnosed with dementia, despite having little in the way of other differences in health issues or treatments.</p>
<h2>What a day</h2>
<p>This study didn't come out of nowhere. There have been a number of hints recently that members of the herpesvirus family that can infect nerve cells are associated with dementia. That group includes Varicella zoster, the virus that causes both chicken pox and—potentially many years after— shingles, an extremely painful rash. And over the past couple of years, observational studies have suggested that the vaccine against shingles may have a protective effect.</p>
<p>But it's extremely difficult to do a clinical trial given that the onset of dementia may happen decades after most people first receive the shingles vaccine. That's why the use of NHS Wales data was critical. When the first attenuated virus vaccine for shingles became available, it was offered to a subset of the Welsh population. Those who were born on or after September 2, 1933, were eligible to receive the vaccine. Anyone older than that was permanently ineligible.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/a-bonus-from-the-shingles-vaccine-dementia-protection/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Among the changes mentioned in yesterday's Nintendo Switch 2 presentation was a note that the new console doesn't just support MicroSD Express cards for augmenting the device's 256GB of internal storage, but it <em>requires </em>MicroSD Express. Whatever plentiful, cheap microSD card you're using in your current Switch, including Sandisk's Nintendo-branded ones, can't migrate over to your Switch 2 alongside all your Switch 1 games.</p>
<h2>MicroSD Express, explained</h2>
<p>Why is regular-old MicroSD no longer good enough? It all comes down to speed.</p>
<p>Most run-of-the-mill SD and microSD cards you can buy today are using some version of the Ultra High Speed (UHS) standard. Designed to augment the default speed (12.5MB/s) and high speed (25MB/s) from the earliest versions of the SD card standard, the three UHS versions enable data transfers of up to 624MB/s.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Samsung has turned to Chinese technology groups to prop up its ailing semiconductor division, as it struggles to secure big US customers despite investing tens of billions of dollars in its American manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>The South Korean electronics group revealed last month that the value of its exports to China jumped 54 percent between 2023 and 2024, as Chinese companies rush to secure stockpiles of advanced artificial intelligence chips in the face of increasingly restrictive US export controls.</p>
<p>In one previously unreported deal, Samsung last year sold more than three years’ supply of logic dies—a key component in manufacturing AI chips—to Kunlun, the semiconductor design subsidiary of Chinese tech group Baidu, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/samsung-turns-to-china-to-boost-its-ailing-semiconductor-division/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be considered the most direct "sequel" to a Nintendo console that the company has ever made. The lineage is right there in the name, with Nintendo simply appending the number "2" onto the name of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">its incredibly successful previous console</a> for the first time in its history.</p>
<p>Nintendo's previous consoles have all differed from their predecessors in novel ways that were reflected in somewhat new naming conventions. The Switch 2's name, on the other hand, suggests that it is content to primarily be "more Switch." And after spending the better part of the day playing around with the Switch 2 hardware and checking out some short game demos on Wednesday, I indeed came away with the impression that this console is "more Switch" in pretty much every way that matters, for better or worse.</p>
<h2>Bigger is better</h2>
<p>We've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">deduced from previous trailers</a> just how much bigger the Switch 2 would be than the original Switch. Even with that preparation, though, the expanded Switch 2 makes a very good first impression in person.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo's Switch 2 presentation gave us <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">pricing for the console</a> ($449 to start) and Nintendo's product pages have given us <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/">pricing information for accessories</a> ($80 for a Pro Controller, $90 for another pair of Joy-Cons, and $110 for a replacement dock, sheesh). But what Nintendo didn't mention during the presentation was game pricing, either for standalone Switch 2 titles or the Switch 2 Edition upgrades for existing Switch games.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced via its website after the presentation that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, the console's flagship launch title, will cost $50 when you buy a digital copy as part of a Switch 2 bundle. But the game will cost $80 when you buy it on its own, $30 more than the pack-in version and $20 more than the usual $60 price for first-party Switch games.</p>
<p>Pre-order listings at US retailers that have gone live since this morning also list several $80 games—<a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/switch-2-hardware-and-software/0/0/?_refineresult=true&amp;_be_shelf_id=7433688&amp;search_sort=100&amp;facet=shelf_id%3A7433688&amp;povid=ets_switch2_pov">we'll use Wal-Mart's</a> as an example. The upgraded Switch 2 Editions for a trio of Switch games—2024's <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, 2023's <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and 2022's <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>—are all going for $80, the same as <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The downsizing includes pushing out about 10,000 full-time employees through early retirements, deferred resignations, and other efforts. Another 10,000 will be laid off in a brutal restructuring, bringing the total HHS workforce from 82,000 to 62,000.</p>

<p>Paramount+ has dropped a tantalizing one-minute teaser for the upcoming third season of <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>., and it looks like the latest adventures of the starship <em>Enterprise</em> will bring romance, comedy, mystery, and even a bit of analog tech, not to mention a brand new villain.</p>

The S3 clip had the situation reversed: The human crew had to make themselves Vulcan to succeed on a new mission but weren't able to change back.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/genres-are-bustin-out-all-over-in-strange-new-worlds-s3-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) are tremendously fond of fermented foodstuffs. Technically, it's the yeast they crave, produced by yummy rotting fruit, but they can consume quite a lot of ethanol as a result of that fruity diet. Yes, fruit flies have ultra-fast metabolisms, the better to burn off the booze, but they can still get falling-down drunk—so much so, that randy inebriated male fruit flies have been known to court other males by mistake and fail to mate successfully.</p>
<p>Then again, apparently adding alcohol to their food increases the production of sex pheromones in male fruit flies, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That, in turn, makes them more attractive to the females of the species.</p>
<p>"We show a direct and positive effect of alcohol consumption on the mating success of male flies," <a href="https://www.ice.mpg.de/493119/PR_Keesey">said co-author Ian Keesey</a> of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. "The effect is caused by the fact that alcohol, especially methanol, increases the production of sex pheromones. This in turn makes alcoholic males more attractive to females and ensures a higher mating success rate, whereas the success of drunken male humans with females is likely to be questionable."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/do-ya-think-im-sexy-male-fruit-flies-more-attractive-when-drunk/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On the heels of releasing its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">most capable AI model yet</a>, Google is making some changes to the Gemini team. A <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/02/2025/google-gemini-shakes-up-ai-leadership-sissie-hsiao-steps-down-replaced-by-josh-woodward">new report</a> from Semafor reveals that longtime Googler Sissie Hsiao will step down from her role leading the Gemini team effective immediately. In her place, Google is appointing Josh Woodward, who currently leads Google Labs.</p>
<p>According to a memo from DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, this change is designed to "sharpen our focus on the next evolution of the Gemini app." This new responsibility won't take Woodward away from his role at Google Labs—he will remain in charge of that division while leading the Gemini team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hsiao says in a message to employees that she is happy with "Chapter 1" of the Bard story and is optimistic for Woodward's "Chapter 2." Hsiao won't be involved in Google's AI efforts for now—she's opted to take some time off before returning to Google in a new role.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-shakes-up-gemini-leadership-google-labs-head-taking-the-reins/">Read full article</a></p>
