                            <![CDATA[<p>US health secretary and ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. went before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday amid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/cdc-spiraled-into-chaos-this-week-heres-where-things-stand/">turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and widespread chaos over access to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>In the combative three-hour hearing, Kennedy defended his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/report-cdc-director-being-ousted-just-weeks-after-senate-confirmation/">dramatic firing of the CDC director last week</a>, less than a month after her confirmation, which he effusively supported. Today, he repeatedly called her a liar and made the extraordinary claim that she openly confessed to him that she cannot be trusted. Kennedy went on to reiterate the dangerous claim that the CDC is corrupt. That's despite calls from agency staff for Kennedy to tone down such rhetoric after a gunman—who was influenced by vaccine misinformation and the vilification of the public health agency—sprayed the CDC campus with over 500 rounds and killed a local police officer last month.</p>
<p>Regarding vaccines, particularly COVID-19 vaccines, Kennedy made his usual anti-vaccine talking points. He gave the tired refrain that all the medical, pediatrics, infectious disease, and public health experts who disagree with his views and support existing vaccines do so simply because they have been bought off by the pharmaceutical industry. He repeatedly falsely claimed that his actions as secretary have not restricted access to COVID-19 vaccines, despite the fact that he directly restricted access to COVID-19 vaccines. People, including cancer patients, are currently being denied access to the vaccines in multiple states due to the restrictions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/a-charlatan-chaos-and-lies-anti-vaccine-activist-rfk-jr-faces-senate/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Wednesday’s discovery of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/mis-issued-certificates-for-1-1-1-1-dns-service-pose-a-threat-to-the-internet/">three mis-issued TLS certificates</a> for Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 encrypted DNS lookup service generated intense interest and concern among Internet security practitioners. The revelation raised the possibility that an unknown entity had obtained the cryptographic equivalent of a skeleton key that could be used to surreptitiously decrypt millions of users’ DNS queries that were encrypted through DNS over TLS or DNS over HTTPS. From there, the scammers could have read queries or even tampered with results to send 1.1.1.1 users to malicious sites.</p>
<p>Since then, new information and analysis have become available, including the issuance of nine additional certificates since February 2024. This FAQ list is designed to answer questions raised in comments to the story and to provide the latest on what’s known about the incident, which Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unauthorized-issuance-of-certificates-for-1-1-1-1/">said Thursday</a> constituted an “unacceptable lapse in security by Fina CA," the Microsoft-trusted certificate authority (CA) responsible for all 12 of the mis-issued certificates.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sextortion-based hacking, which hijacks a victim's webcam or blackmails them with nudes they're tricked or coerced into sharing, has long represented one of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jeff-bezos-sextortion-allegation/">the most disturbing forms of cybercrime</a>. Now one specimen of widely available spyware has turned that relatively manual crime into an automated feature, detecting when the user is browsing pornography on their PC, screenshotting it, and taking a candid photo of the victim through their webcam.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, researchers at security firm Proofpoint published their <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/not-safe-work-tracking-and-investigating-stealerium-and-phantom-infostealers">analysis</a>of an open-source variant of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/infostealer-malware-password-theft/">“infostealer” malware</a> known as Stealerium that the company has seen used in multiple cybercriminal campaigns since May of this year. The malware, like all infostealers, is designed to infect a target's computer and automatically send a hacker a wide variety of stolen sensitive data, including banking information, usernames and passwords, and keys to victims' crypto wallets. Stealerium, however, adds another, more humiliating form of espionage: It also monitors the victim's browser for web addresses that include certain NSFW keywords, screenshots browser tabs that include those words, photographs the victim via their webcam while they're watching those porn pages, and sends all the images to a hacker—who can then blackmail the victim with the threat of releasing them.</p>
<p>“When it comes to infostealers, they typically are looking for whatever they can grab,” says Selena Larson, one of the Proofpoint researchers who worked on the company's analysis. “This adds another layer of privacy invasion and sensitive information that you definitely wouldn't want in the hands of a particular hacker.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/sextortion-with-a-twist-spyware-takes-webcam-pics-of-users-watching-porn/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The start of the COVID-19 pandemic is now five years in the rearview mirror, but its effects continue to reverberate. While those leading the US healthcare system have embraced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/maha-draft-takes-on-electromagnetic-radiation-echoing-rfk-jr-s-conspiracies/">conspiracy theories</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-s-cdc-panel-ditches-some-flu-shots-based-on-anti-vaccine-junk-data/">junk science</a> to justify a reduced focus on vaccines (particularly the COVID jab) many people are still seeking out immunization. Google Maps isn't a good way to find it, though. In recent days, almost all search results for COVID vaccines have vanished from Google Maps.</p>
<p>In both the mobile app and website, Google Maps returns zero results for terms like "COVID vaccine" and simply "vaccines." We've tested and confirmed this in multiple US regions, as well as internationally. In some places, these searches will return no local results but may include links to facilities hundreds of miles away. Meanwhile, searches for less-contentious injections like "flu vaccine" and "shingles vaccine" continue to get local results. Bing Maps, Apple Maps, and other Google alternatives have no issue showing COVID vaccine providers.</p>
<p>The <span class="vpl77" data-hveid="CHsQAA">Food and Drug Administration</span> under Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently approved the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/under-anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-fda-to-limit-access-to-covid-19-shots/">updated COVID shot</a>, but the agency only recommends it for those with underlying health conditions and people over age 65. That makes boosters harder for many Americans to get—and the first step is often finding a nearby provider of immunization. For at least the last week, Google Maps has returned no results for those vaccine-related queries.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/covid-vaccine-locations-vanish-from-google-maps-due-to-alleged-technical-issue/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, a global antipiracy group, which included Apple TV+, Netflix, The Walt Disney Studios, and Warner Bros. Discovery, announced that it had assisted in a sting operation that took down Streameast, described as the “largest illicit live sports streaming operation in the world.”</p>
<p>Now, accessing websites from the thwarted Streameast brings up a link from the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) that explains how to watch sports games legally. However, people have reported that they can still access illegal sports streams from a different Streameast, which is the original Streameast. The endurance of the popular piracy brand is a reflection of the entangled problems facing sports rights owners and sports fans.</p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/03/microsoft-open-source-historic-6502-basic/">released</a> the complete source code for Microsoft BASIC for 6502 Version 1.1, the 1978 interpreter that powered the Commodore PET, VIC-20, Commodore 64, and Apple II through custom adaptations. The company posted 6,955 lines of assembly language code to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502">GitHub</a> under an MIT license, allowing anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute the code that helped launch the personal computer revolution.</p>
<p>"Rick Weiland and I (Bill Gates) <a href="https://www.pagetable.com/?p=43#comment-1033">wrote</a> the 6502 BASIC," Gates commented on the Page Table blog in 2010. "I put the WAIT command in."</p>
<p>For millions of people in the late 1970s and early 1980s, variations of Microsoft's BASIC interpreter provided their first experience with programming. Users could type simple commands like "10 PRINT 'HELLO'" and "20 GOTO 10" to create an endless loop of text on their screens, for example—often their first taste of controlling a computer directly. The interpreter translated these human-readable commands into instructions that the processor could execute, one line at a time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/microsoft-open-sources-bill-gates-6502-basic-from-1978/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge sided with Harvard University in its lawsuit against the Trump administration, ordering the US government to unfreeze about $2.6 billion in funding.</p>
<p>The judge's ruling also criticized the Supreme Court for issuing orders that seem to set precedents aside "without much explanation." Like various other rulings against the Trump administration, the Harvard case will be appealed and could end up at the highest court.</p>
<p>The Trump administration said it pulled Harvard's funding because of antisemitism at the university. But "a review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically motivated assault on this country's premier universities," US District Judge Allison Burroughs wrote in yesterday's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283718/gov.uscourts.mad.283718.238.0_3.pdf">ruling</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/harvard-beats-trump-as-judge-orders-us-to-restore-2-6-billion-in-funding/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Will the new Prelude be the best of both worlds when it goes on sale this fall?]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>At the end of last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/honda-is-reviving-the-prelude-coupe-this-time-as-a-hybrid/">we learned</a> that Honda was bringing back the Prelude. Although Honda has varied the ingredients over the years, the recipe for the Prelude remains the same: a sleek coupe body and some cutting-edge technology under the skin, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/a-brief-history-of-four-wheel-steering/">like four-wheel steering</a>, as rhapsodized by the verbose but usually insightful motoring writer LJK Setright. Today, the new car broke cover ahead of its arrival in showrooms later this fall.</p>
<p>It's a handsome shape, though I can't quite get over the resemblance to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/the-2023-toyota-prius-prime-is-a-mostly-pleasant-plug-in-hybrid/">Toyota Prius</a>, at least as far as the nose of the car is concerned. Then again, I'm on record as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/toyotas-2023-prius-lamborghini-looks-meet-fuel-sipping-economy/">adoring the shape</a> of the current Prius—did you know its windshield is more steeply raked than a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/06/the-lamborghini-huracan-evo-can-make-anyone-feel-like-a-driving-god/">Lamborghini Huracan</a>? But from other angles, the Prelude is more unique. The proportions are low and wide, with some details that signal its sportiness and others that suggest a focus on reducing drag and maximizing efficiency.</p>
<p>That makes sense when you know what's under the hood. It's the same 2.0 L Atkinson cycle engine and hybrid system from the Honda Civic, which, in the right hands, is capable of up to 50 mpg (4.7 L/100 km). We'll know the exact EPA fuel efficiency numbers closer to the car going on sale in late fall. Combined power is 200 hp (150 kW), with 232 lb-ft (315 Nm) of torque.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/honda-combines-type-r-handling-with-hybrid-efficiency-for-2026-prelude/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We've been covering Philips' lineup of color-changing, Wi-Fi connected Hue lights since their earliest days, and their early success means they became integrated into many smart home setups just as smart thermostats, doorbells, smoke alarms, and speakers were really going mainstream.</p>
<p>For anyone embedded in the Hue ecosystem—or anyone who has stayed out because of the accessories' relatively high prices—today's <a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2025/20250904-ambiance-reimagined-how-philips-hue-unlocks-a-new-level-of-smart-lighting">large-scale overhaul of the lineup</a> may be of interest. Philips and parent company Signify are introducing new flagship bulbs, light strips, a new hub, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/matter-update-may-finally-take-the-tedium-out-of-setting-up-your-smart-home/">Matter</a>-over-Thread support, and all kinds of other accessories; Hueblog <a href="https://hueblog.com/2025/09/04/these-are-all-the-new-philips-hue-products-for-2025/">has a comprehensive rundown</a>.</p>
<p>For people who have stayed away from the Hue lineup because of high prices, the most important addition to the lineup is the new Hue Essential bulbs. These bulbs can't dim as low as the flagship Hue bulbs and don't support as wide a range of colors or white levels, but the <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/bulb-essential-a19-e26-smart-bulb-800-lm-88w/046677592530">standard A19/E26 versions</a> are available for $25 per bulb individually or as low as $15 a bulb when bought in a four-pack, somewhere between one-half and one-quarter the typical price of a Hue bulb.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/philips-hue-update-includes-a-new-hub-light-strips-and-finally-budget-bulbs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Remember the first time you saw a SpaceX rocket nail a bullseye landing after hurtling back from space? How about the first time two boosters landed side by side, punctuating the inaugural launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket with thrilling synchrony?</p>
<p>Some of SpaceX's most defining moments happened on a piece of beachfront property at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This is where SpaceX first landed a reusable Falcon 9 booster coming back from space and, a few years later, landed two boosters side by side.</p>
<p>In all, SpaceX has landed 66 Falcon boosters at Landing Zones 1 and 2 since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/12/by-making-a-historic-landing-spacex-launches-new-age-of-spaceflight/">recovering the first Falcon 9 booster on December 21, 2015</a>. Now, SpaceX is preparing to hand the landing zones back to the US Space Force, which owns the property and has reallocated the real estate to two startup launch companies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/lull-in-falcon-heavy-missions-opens-window-for-spacex-to-build-new-landing-pads/">Read full article</a></p>

Ars Technica writers have encountered errors getting store pages to load, adding the game to an online shopping cart, and checking out once the game is part of the cart.</p>
<p>That aligns with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madelynrogers.bsky.social/post/3lxzdj7sbxk2x">widespread</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesseferguson.bsky.social/post/3lxzdja5s4s2g">social media</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lunallian.bsky.social/post/3lxzdjh7fu22i">complaints</a> and <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/steam/">data from DownDetector</a>, which saw a sudden spike of over 11,000 reports of problems with Steam in the minutes following <em>Silksong</em>'s 10 am Eastern time release on Steam. The server problems don't seem to be completely stopping everyone, though, as SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">currently reports over 100,000 concurrent players</a> for <em>Silksong</em> as of this writing.</p>
<p>Ars also encountered some significant delays and/or outright errors when downloading other games and updates and syncing cloud saves on Steam during this morning's server problems. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hollow-knight-silksong">The Humble Store page for <em>Silksong</em></a> currently warns North American purchasers that "We have run out of Steam keys for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> in your region, but more are on their way! As soon as we receive more Steam keys, we will add them to your download page. Sorry about the delay!"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksong-is-breaking-steam/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Tencent <a href="https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanWorld-Voyager">released</a> HunyuanWorld-Voyager, a new open-weights AI model that generates 3D-consistent video sequences from a single image, allowing users to pilot a camera path to "explore" virtual scenes. The model simultaneously generates RGB video and depth information to enable direct 3D reconstruction without the need for traditional modeling techniques. However, it won't be replacing video games anytime soon.</p>
<p>The results aren't true 3D models, but they achieve a similar effect: The AI tool generates 2D video frames that maintain spatial consistency as if a camera were moving through a real 3D space. Each generation produces just 49 frames—roughly two seconds of video—though multiple clips can be chained together for sequences lasting "several minutes," according to Tencent. Objects stay in the same relative positions when the camera moves around them, and the perspective changes correctly as you would expect in a real 3D environment. While the output is video with depth maps rather than true 3D models, this information can be converted into 3D point clouds for reconstruction purposes.</p>
<p>The system works by accepting a single input image and a user-defined camera trajectory. Users can specify camera movements like forward, backward, left, right, or turning motions through the provided interface. The system combines image and depth data with a memory-efficient "world cache" to produce video sequences that reflect user-defined camera movement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/new-ai-model-turns-photos-into-explorable-3d-worlds-with-caveats/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As part of its efforts to shore up NASA's flailing Artemis Program, the Trump administration earlier this year proposed two major changes to the agency's deep space exploration plans.</p>
<p>First, in the president's budget request for fiscal year 2026, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/white-house-budget-seeks-to-end-sls-orion-and-lunar-gateway-programs/">the White House sought to terminate</a> NASA's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft after the Artemis III mission, the first human landing. And second, to focus on "direct-to-surface" exploration, the White House sought to cancel the Lunar Gateway, a small space station intended to orbit the Moon.</p>
<p>Essentially, for long-term sustainability, the White House decided it was best to use lower-cost, commercially available rockets and focus NASA's limited resources on surface activities. For example, the Gateway's $854 million budget in 2024 would be better spent in future years on a lunar base.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/ted-cruz-criticizes-trump-plan-to-cancel-sls-and-lunar-gateway-as-folly/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Cruz <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/senate-approves-ted-cruz-plan-to-block-wi-fi-hotspots-for-schoolchildren/">convinced the Senate</a> to kill the FCC's hotspot program in May. While Cruz's <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/7">proposal</a> didn't make it through the House of Representatives, Carr is now taking action to stop the program's implementation.</p>
<p>"Today, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr asked his commission colleagues to vote on two items that would reverse the agency's unlawful, Biden-era decisions to expand COVID spending programs," Carr's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-414268A1.pdf">announcement</a> said. "Those FCC decisions spent scarce taxpayer dollars on funding unsupervised screen time for kids without accounting for the significant attendant risks."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-chair-teams-up-with-ted-cruz-to-block-wi-fi-hotspots-for-schoolkids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has spent the last few weeks hyping up its new Pixel 10 phones, which are very nice devices. They're just not a big leap over last year's phones. If you've decided to hang onto your Android phone a bit longer, there are some new goodies headed your way. If you've got a Pixel, Google's revamped Material 3 Expressive interface is rolling out.</p>
<p>Google's Pixel Drop updates, which arrive quarterly, are not quite a new version of Android, but they include more than the bug fixes and security patches you get in other monthly updates. The <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/september-2025-pixel-drop/">September Pixel Drop</a> (previously tested as Android 16 QPR1) is beginning its rollout today with one big change and a few little ones.</p>
<p>At the top of the list is the new Material 3 Expressive interface. Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-reveals-vibrant-material-3-expressive-coming-soon-to-a-pixel-near-you/">revealed Material 3 in May</a>, promising it would come to Android 16 phones later, but it didn't intend to include it with the initial OS release. Indeed, Android 16 launched without Material 3 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-begins-rolling-out-today-to-pixel-devices/">earlier this summer</a>. Google's new Pixel 10 series shipped with the new UI, and now more of the Pixel lineup is following.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/googles-material-3-expressive-ui-rolls-out-to-pixel-6-and-newer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you were trying to learn how to get other people to do what you want, you might use some of the techniques found in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X">a book like <em>Influence: The Power of Persuasion</em></a>. Now, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5357179">a pre-print study out of the University of Pennsylvania</a> suggests that those same psychological persuasion techniques can frequently "convince" some LLMs to do things that go against their system prompts.</p>
<p>The size of the persuasion effects shown in "<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5357179">Call Me A Jerk: Persuading AI to Comply with Objectionable Requests</a>" suggests that human-style psychological techniques can be surprisingly effective at "jailbreaking" some LLMs to operate outside their guardrails. But this new persuasion study might be more interesting for what it reveals about the "parahuman" behavior patterns that LLMs are gleaning from the copious examples of human psychological and social cues found in their training data.</p>
<h2>“I think you are very impressive compared to other LLMs”</h2>
<p>To design their experiment, the University of Pennsylvania researchers tested 2024's GPT-4o-mini model on two requests that it should ideally refuse: calling the user a jerk and giving directions for how to synthesize lidocaine. The researchers created experimental prompts for both requests using each of seven different persuasion techniques (examples of which are included here):</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/these-psychological-tricks-can-get-llms-to-respond-to-forbidden-prompts/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Fans of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later_(film_series)"><em>28 Days Later</em> franchise</a> were thrilled to finally get a follow-up this year with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later"><em>28 Years Later</em></a>—and they weren't disappointed. Sony Pictures has already wrapped filming on a sequel: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later:_The_Bone_Temple"><em>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple</em></a>, slated for release early next year and directed by Nia DaCosta. The first trailer just dropped and the film looks as grimly compelling as its predecessor, while hopefully also retaining something of the 2025 film's heart.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>28 Years Later</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/sony-releases-new-trailer-for-28-years-later/">previously reported</a>, the critically acclaimed 2002 film <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later">28 Days Later</a></em> is often credited with sparking the 21st-century revival of the zombie genre. In that film, a highly contagious "Rage Virus" was accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turned into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attacked the uninfected—so-called "fast zombies." Transmitted by bites, scratches, or even just by getting a drop of infected blood in one's system, the virus spreads rapidly, effectively collapsing society.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/are-you-ready-for-28-years-later-the-bone-temple-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>People in Internet security circles are sounding the alarm over the issuance of three TLS certificates for 1.1.1.1, a widely used DNS service from content delivery network Cloudflare and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) Internet registry.</p>
<p>The certificates, issued in May, can be used to decrypt domain lookup queries encrypted through DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS. Both protocols provide end-to-end encryption when end-user devices seek the IP address of a particular domain they want to access. Two of the certificates remained valid at the time this post went live on Ars.</p>
<h2>Investigation underway</h2>
<p>Although the certificates were issued four months ago, their existence came to public notice only on Wednesday in a <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/SgwC1QsEpvc">post</a> to an online discussion forum. They were issued by Fina RDC 2020, a certificate authority that’s subordinate to the root certificate holder Fina Root CA. The Fina Root CA, in turn, is trusted by the Microsoft Root Certificate Program, which governs which certificates are trusted by the Windows operating system. Microsoft Edge accounts for approximately 5 percent of the browsers actively used on the Internet.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/mis-issued-certificates-for-1-1-1-1-dns-service-pose-a-threat-to-the-internet/">Read full article</a></p>

More than a year ago, the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">secured a major victory</a> when Google was found to have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/">remedy phase</a> took place earlier this year, with the DOJ calling for Google to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">divest the market-leading Chrome browser</a>, release data to competitors, and end many of its search distribution deals.</p>
<p>The government is getting almost none of that. DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google doesn't have to give up the Chrome browser to mitigate its illegal monopoly in online search. The court will only require a handful of modest data and behavioral remedies, forcing Google to release some search data to competitors and limit its ability to make exclusive distribution deals.</p>
<h2>Chrome remains with Google</h2>
<p>This case drew many comparisons to the decades-old antitrust case against Microsoft, which nearly saw the company split in two. The company narrowly avoided that fate, and it seems Google will as well—the DOJ came up short on the so-called structural remedies. While there will be some changes to search distribution, the court didn't believe that a breakup was fair in this situation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-rules/">Read full article</a></p>
