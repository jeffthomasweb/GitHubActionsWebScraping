                            <![CDATA[<p>During an earnings call on Monday, Rocket Lab chief executive Pete Beck announced that the company’s medium-lift launch vehicle, Neutron, would not launch this year.</p>
<p>For anyone with the slightest understanding of the challenges involved in bringing a new rocket to the launch pad, as well as a calendar, the delay does not come as a surprise. Although Rocket Lab had been holding on to the possibility of launching Neutron this year publicly, it has been clear for months that a slip into 2026 was inevitable.</p>
<p>According to Beck, speaking during a third-quarter 2025 earnings call, the new timeline has the company bringing Neutron to Launch Complex 2 at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia during the first quarter of next year. The first launch is scheduled to occur “thereafter,” according to the company’s plans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/neutron-rockets-debut-slips-into-mid-2026-as-company-seeks-success-from-the-start/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Intuitive Machines announced last week an $800 million acquisition that will catapult the one-time startup into the space industry establishment.</p>
<p>The company’s planned purchase of Lanteris Space Systems, a satellite manufacturer you may have never heard of, is rather significant. Lanteris is the latest addition to a line of corporate brands that dates back to 1957. Until last month, the company was known as Maxar Space Systems. Its acquisition by Intuitive Machines would be perhaps the industry’s most evident example of a “New Space” firm buying up an “Old Space” company.</p>
<p>The deal would help Intuitive Machines expand beyond its core competency of Moon missions to the broader sector of satellite manufacturing and space services. Lanteris has been owned since 2023 by Advent International, a private equity firm. The transaction is expected to close early next year, subject to “customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions,” according to Intuitive Machines.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/intuitive-machines-known-for-its-moon-landers-will-become-a-military-contractor/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When engineers build AI language models like GPT-5 from training data, at least two major processing features emerge: memorization (reciting exact text they’ve seen before, like famous quotes or passages from books) and reasoning (solving new problems using general principles). New research from AI startup <a href="https://www.goodfire.ai/">Goodfire.ai</a> provides the first potentially clear evidence that these different functions actually work through completely separate neural pathways in the model’s architecture.</p>
<p>The researchers discovered that this separation proves remarkably clean. In a preprint paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24256">released</a> in late October, they described that when they removed the memorization pathways, models lost 97 percent of their ability to recite training data verbatim but kept nearly all their “logical reasoning” ability intact.</p>
<p>For example, at layer 22 in Allen Institute for AI’s <a href="https://allenai.org/olmo">OLMo-7B</a> language model, the bottom 50 percent of weight components showed 23 percent higher activation on memorized data, while the top 10 percent showed 26 percent higher activation on general, non-memorized text. This mechanistic split enabled the researchers to surgically remove memorization while preserving other capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/study-finds-ai-models-store-memories-and-logic-in-different-neural-regions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Canada has lost its measles elimination status, meaning the highly infectious virus is considered endemic once again in the country, The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) announced Monday.</p>
<p>The determination was made by a committee of PAHO experts, who spent last week poring over disease data to assess the measles status of countries across the entire region. The fact that Canada has lost its elimination status means that the region of the Americas overall has also lost the status, which it achieved in 2016. Of the 35 countries and territories in the region—a health region designated by the World Health Organization—Canada is currently the only country where measles is considered to be spreading endemically, though other countries, namely the US and Mexico, are headed in the same direction.</p>
<p>Measles is considered eliminated when a country can go 12 months without continuous local spread. Sporadic cases brought in from international travel can continue to occur, potentially causing limited outbreaks. But elimination is lost and endemicity is declared only when transmission is sustained over the course of a year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/canada-fought-measles-and-measles-won-virus-now-endemic-after-1998-elimination/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The heads of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/10/apple-tv-streaming-service-is-renamed-to-just-apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> have “no plans” to bring ads to the streaming service, balking, at least for now, at a strategy that has driven success for Apple’s streaming rivals.</p>
<p>In its November 2025 issue, British movie magazine <a href="https://edition.pagesuite.com/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&amp;edid=a04b0b1b-3c41-4db4-8e10-bd27650bed81">Screen International</a> asked Eddy Cue, senior vice president of Apple Services, if there are plans to launch an ad-based subscription tier for Apple TV. Cue responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing at this time. … I don’t want to say no forever, but there are no plans. If we can stay aggressive with our pricing, it’s better for consumers not to get interrupted with ads.</p></blockquote>
<p>The comments follow reports over the years suggesting that Apple has been seeking knowledge on how to build a streaming ads business. Most recently, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/07/27/apple-tv-plots-uk-adverts/">The Telegraph</a> reported that Apple TV executives met with the United Kingdom’s ratings body, Barb, to discuss what tracking ads on Apple TV would look like. In 2023, Apple <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-hires-ad-executive-for-apple-tv-a-sign-of-apples-video-ad-ambitions">hired</a> advertising exec Lauren Fry as head of video and Apple News ad sales.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/11/apple-has-no-plans-to-bring-ads-to-apple-tv/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/valves-steam-play-uses-vulkan-to-bring-more-windows-games-to-linux/">For years now</a>, Valve has been slowly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">improving the capabilities</a> of the Proton compatibility layer that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/valves-deck-verified-badge-will-show-which-games-run-well-on-steam-deck/">lets thousands of Windows games work seamlessly on the Linux-based SteamOS</a>. But Valve’s Windows-to-Linux compatibility layer generally only extends back to games written for Direct3D 8, the proprietary Windows graphics API Microsoft released in late 2000.</p>
<p>Now, a new open source project is seeking to extend Linux interoperability further back into PC gaming history. The <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk">d7vk project</a> describes itself as “a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7 [D3D7], which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine.”</p>
<h2>More options are always welcome</h2>
<p>The new project <a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Wrappers">isn’t the first attempt</a> to get Direct3D 7 games running on Linux. <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>‘s own built-in WineD3D compatibility layer has supported D3D7 in some form or another <a href="https://list.winehq.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/wine-devel@winehq.org/thread/ZZF36RVFBXKZJRX5RW4ZYWRUPR4LB5PS/?sort=date">for at least two decades now</a>. But the new d7vk project instead branches off <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk">the existing dxvk compatibility layer</a>, which is <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/dxvk">already used by Valve’s Proton</a> for SteamOS and which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1dcctnd/on_technical_level_why_dxvk_has_better/">reportedly offers better performance than WineD3D</a> on many games.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/new-project-brings-strong-linux-compatibility-to-more-classic-windows-games/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A new simulation could help solve one of astronomy’s longstanding mysteries—how supermassive black holes formed so rapidly—along with a new one: What are the James Webb Space Telescope’s (JWST) “little red dots?”</p>
<p>Invisible leviathans lurk at the cores of nearly all of the 2 trillion or so galaxies strewn throughout space-time. Monster black holes entered the cosmic scene soon after the Universe’s birth and grew rapidly, reaching millions or even billions of times the Sun’s mass in less than a billion years. Astronomers have long wondered how these supermassive black holes could have grown so hefty in such little time.</p>
<p>The monster black hole mystery became even more perplexing in 2022 when “<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/newfound-galaxy-class-may-indicate-early-black-hole-growth-webb-finds/">little red dots</a>” were spotted at the far edges of space. When these tiny scarlet orbs began unexpectedly popping up in JWST images of the distant Universe, their nature was hotly debated. Now that scientists have amassed a sample of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025AAS...24513907K/abstract">hundreds of them</a>, many think the dots are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acdc9d/pdf">growing supermassive black holes</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/runaway-black-hole-mergers-may-have-built-supermassive-black-holes/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>It’s shaping up to be an excellent season for Stephen King adaptations. In September, we got <em>The Long Walk</em>, an excellent (though harrowing) adaptation of King’s 1979 Richard Bachman novel. Last month, HBO debuted its new series <em>IT: Welcome to Derry</em>, which explores the mythology and origins of Pennywise the killer clown. And this Friday is the premiere of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Running_Man_(2025_film)"><em>The Running Man</em></a>, director Edgar Wright’s (<em>Shaun of the Dead</em>,<em> Baby Driver</em>,<em> Last Night in Soho</em>) take on King’s novel of the same name. So naturally Paramount has released a final trailer to lure us to the theater.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/glen-powell-plays-a-dangerous-game-in-the-running-man-trailer/">previously reported</a>, the 1987 action film starring Schwarzenegger was only loosely based on King’s novel, preserving the basic concept and very little else in favor of more sci-fi gadgetry and high-octane action. It was a noisy, entertaining romp—and very late ’80s—but it lacked King’s subtler satirical tone. Wright expressed interest in adapting his own version of <em>The Running Man</em> in 2017, and Paramount greenlit the project four years later. Wright and co-screenwriter Michael Bacall envisioned their film as less of a remake and more of a faithful adaptation of King’s original novel. (We’ll see if that faithfulness extends to the novel’s bleak ending.)</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After a weekend off, perhaps spent trick or treating, Formula 1’s drivers, engineers, and mechanics made their yearly trip to the Interlagos track for the Brazilian Grand Prix. More formally called the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace, it’s definitely one of the more old-school circuits that F1 visits—and invariably one of the more dramatic.</p>
<p>For one thing, it’s anything but billiard-smooth. Better yet, there’s elevation—lots of it—and cambers, too. Unlike most F1 tracks, it runs counterclockwise, and it combines some very fast sections with several rather technical corners that can catch out even the best drivers in the world. Nestled between a couple of lakes in São Paulo, weather is also a regular factor in races here. And indeed, a severe weather warning was issued in the lead-up to this weekend’s race.</p>
<h2>You have to hit the ground running</h2>
<p>This was another sprint weekend, which means that instead of two practice sessions on Friday and another on Saturday morning, the teams get one on Friday, then go into qualifying for the Saturday sprint race. The shortened testing time tends to shake things up a bit, and we definitely saw that this weekend.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/f1-in-brazil-thats-what-generational-talent-looks-like/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>It cannot happen soon enough.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is, to put it bluntly, kind of a mess. This is not meant to disparage the many fine people who work at NASA. But years of neglect, changing priorities, mismanagement, creeping bureaucracy, meeting bloat, and other factors have taken their toll. NASA is still capable of doing great things. It still inspires.

<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida<span class="s1">—</span>The field of astrodynamics isn’t a magical discipline, but sometimes it seems like trajectory analysts can pull a solution out of a hat.</p>
<p>That’s what it took to save NASA’s ESCAPADE mission from a lengthy delay, and possible cancellation, after its rocket wasn’t ready to send it toward Mars during its appointed launch window last year. ESCAPADE, short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, consists of two identical spacecraft setting off for the red planet as soon as Sunday with a launch aboard Blue Origin’s massive New Glenn rocket.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/heres-how-orbital-dynamics-wizardry-helped-save-nasas-next-mars-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“We just want to help the US get to the Moon,” said Dave Limp, CEO of the space company founded by Jeff Bezos. “If NASA wants to go quicker, we would move heaven and Earth, pun intended, to try to get to the Moon sooner. And I think we have some good ideas.”</p>
<p>Limp spoke on Saturday, about 24 hours ahead of the company’s second launch of the large New Glenn rocket. Carrying the ESCAPADE spacecraft for NASA, the mission has a launch window that opens at 2:45 pm ET (19:45 UTC) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and runs for a little more than two hours.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/blue-origin-will-move-heaven-and-earth-to-help-nasa-reach-the-moon-faster-ceo-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>James Dewey Watson, who helped reveal DNA’s double-helix structure, kicked off the Human Genome Project, and became infamous for his racist, sexist, and otherwise offensive statements, has died. He was 97.</p>
<p>His death was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/science/james-watson-dead.html">confirmed to The New York Times</a> by his son Duncan, who said Watson died on Thursday in a hospice in East Northport, New York, on Long Island. He had previously been hospitalized with an infection. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/in-remembrance-of-dr-james-d-watson/">also confirmed his passing</a>.</p>
<p>Watson was born in Chicago in 1928 and attained scientific fame in 1953 at 25 years old for solving the molecular structure of DNA—the genetic blueprints for life—with his colleague Francis Crick at England’s Cavendish laboratory. Their discovery heavily relied on the work of chemist and crystallographer Rosalind Franklin at King’s College in London, whose X-ray images of DNA provided critical clues to the molecule’s twisted-ladder-like architecture. One image in particular from Franklin’s lab, Photo 51, made Watson and Crick’s discovery possible. But, she was not fully credited for her contribution. The image was given to Watson and Crick without Franklin’s knowledge or consent by Maurice Wilkins, a biophysicist and colleague of Franklin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/james-watson-who-helped-unravel-dnas-double-helix-has-died/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The next time you encounter an unusually polite reply on social media, you might want to check twice. It could be an AI model trying (and failing) to blend in with the crowd.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, researchers from the University of Zurich, University of Amsterdam, Duke University, and New York University <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04195">released</a> a study revealing that AI models remain easily distinguishable from humans in social media conversations, with overly friendly emotional tone serving as the most persistent giveaway. The research, which tested nine open-weight models across Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Reddit, found that classifiers developed by the researchers detected AI-generated replies with 70 to 80 percent accuracy.</p>
<p>The study introduces what the authors call a “computational Turing test” to assess how closely AI models approximate human language. Instead of relying on subjective human judgment about whether text sounds authentic, the framework uses automated classifiers and linguistic analysis to identify specific features that distinguish machine-generated from human-authored content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/11/being-too-nice-online-is-a-dead-giveaway-for-ai-bots-study-suggests/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Another day, another malware attack on smartphones. Researchers at Unit 42, the threat intelligence arm of Palo Alto Networks, have revealed a sophisticated spyware known as “Landfall” targeting Samsung Galaxy phones. The researchers say this campaign leveraged a zero-day exploit in Samsung Android software to steal a raft of personal data, and it was active for almost a year. Thankfully, the underlying vulnerability has now been patched, and the attacks were most likely targeted at specific groups.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/landfall-is-new-commercial-grade-android-spyware/">Unit 42 says</a> that Landfall first appeared in July 2024, relying on a software flaw now catalogued as CVE-2025-21042. Samsung issued a patch for its phones in April 2025, but details of the attack have only been revealed now.</p>
<p>Even if you were out there poking around the darker corners of the Internet in 2024 and early 2025 with a Samsung Galaxy device, it’s unlikely you’d be infected. The team believes Landfall was used in the Middle East to target individuals for surveillance. It is currently unclear who was behind the attacks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/commercial-spyware-landfall-ran-rampant-on-samsung-phones-for-almost-a-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The federal government shutdown, now in its 38th day, prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary emergency order Thursday prohibiting commercial rocket launches from occurring during “peak hours” of air traffic.</p>
<p>The FAA also directed commercial airlines to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/list-40-airports-faa-flight-cancellations-capacity-cuts-government-shutdown-proposed/">reduce domestic flights</a> from 40 “high impact airports” across the country in a phased approach beginning Friday. The agency said the order from the FAA’s administrator, Bryan Bedford, is aimed at addressing “safety risks and delays presented by air traffic controller staffing constraints caused by the continued lapse in appropriations.”</p>
<p>The government considers air traffic controllers essential workers, so they remain on the job without pay until Congress passes a federal budget and President Donald Trump signs it into law. The shutdown’s effects, which affected federal workers most severely at first, are now rippling across the broader economy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/faa-says-commercial-rockets-must-launch-at-night-citing-government-shutdown/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has a ‘for sale’ sign up. And that could mean big changes for subscribers to the company’s most popular streaming service, HBO Max.</p>
<p>After receiving unsolicited acquisition offers, WBD recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/warner-bros-discovery-raises-hbo-max-prices-as-it-puts-itself-up-for-sale/">declared itself open</a> to “strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.” WBD <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/comcast-warner-bros-discovery-bankers-bid-1236571997/">drew new attention</a> by being open to selling its streaming business (WBD is also still open to moving forward with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-split-two-companies-streaming-tv-1236423250/">previously shared plans</a> to split into a cable company and a streaming and movie studios company next year).</p>
<p>Naturally, mergers and acquisitions talk has heated up since then, with Paramount as one of the most <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/05/warner-bros-discovery-wbd-sale-split-plans-deadline.html">eager suitors</a>. Paramount, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/paramount-skydance-media-cbs-trump-merger-a030c4f2c1903ed0e7f927782a64fcc0">merged with Skydance</a> in August, is reportedly planning to keep “much of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. intact” if a deal happens, per a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/paramount-sets-steps-to-get-warner-deal-past-opponents-agencies">Bloomberg</a> report that cited unnamed people familiar with the plans of David Ellison, Paramount’s CEO.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/higher-prices-simpler-streaming-expected-if-hbo-max-folds-into-paramount/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The subpoena is supposed to be secret, but the Archive.today X account <a href="https://x.com/archiveis/status/1984093883056422993">posted the document</a> on October 30, the same day the subpoena was issued.

                            <![CDATA[<p>At a White House event Thursday, President Trump announced deals with drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to offer their popular GLP-1 obesity and diabetes drugs at lower prices for some Americans, namely some on Medicare and Medicaid plans. But questions linger about the significance of the deal.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-major-developments-in-bringing-most-favored-nation-pricing-to-american-patients/">the announcement</a>, Medicare and state Medicaid programs will be able to purchase a month’s supply of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound at $245 each for eligible patients. Eligible people on Medicare will have a $50 co-pay.</p>
<p>The negotiated price is a significant cut from the drugs’ list prices: The list price for Ozempic is $997, Wegovy is $1,350, Mounjaro is $1,080, and Zepbound is $1,086. But, of course, purchasers rarely pay drug list prices. It’s unclear how much Medicare and Medicaid would have paid for the drugs without this deal and what the savings will be.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/questions-swirl-after-trumps-glp-1-pricing-deal-announcement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For months, extremely personal and sensitive ChatGPT conversations have been leaking into an unexpected destination: Google Search Console (GSC), a tool that developers typically use to monitor search traffic, not lurk private chats.</p>
<p>Normally, when site managers access GSC performance reports, they see queries based on keywords or short phrases that Internet users type into Google to find relevant content. But starting this September, odd queries, sometimes more than 300 characters long, could also be found in GSC. Showing only user inputs, the chats appeared to be from unwitting people prompting a chatbot to help solve relationship or business problems, who likely expected those conversations would remain private.</p>
<p>Jason Packer, owner of an analytics consulting firm called Quantable, was among the first to flag the issue in a detailed <a href="https://www.quantable.com/ai/the-old-rules-are-dead/">blog</a> last month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/oddest-chatgpt-leaks-yet-cringey-chat-logs-found-in-google-analytics-tool/">Read full article</a></p>
