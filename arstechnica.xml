                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>New <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-03154-8">research</a> published Thursday bolsters growing concerns that a handful of companies and countries are using the global atmospheric commons as a dumping ground for potentially toxic and climate-altering industrial waste byproducts from loosely regulated commercial space flights.</p>
<p>The new study analyzed a plume of pollution trailing part of a Falcon rocket that crashed through the upper atmosphere on Feb. 19, 2025, after SpaceX lost control of its reentry. The rocket was launched earlier that month, carrying 20 to 22 Starlink satellites into orbit.</p>
<p>The authors said it is the first time debris from a specific spacecraft disintegration has been traced and measured in the near-space region about 80 to 110 kilometers above Earth. Changes there can affect the stratosphere, where ozone and climate processes operate. Until recent years, human activities had little impact in that region.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/study-shows-how-rocket-launches-pollute-the-atmosphere/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The latest issue appeared Friday evening, when data showed an interruption in helium flow into the upper stage of the Space Launch System rocket, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/NASAAdmin/status/2025231621436186837?s=20">post on X</a>. Isaacman posted a more thorough update Saturday, writing that engineers are still examining the potential cause of the problem, but any fixes must take place inside the Vehicle Assembly Building.</p>
<p>That means NASA and contractor ground teams will immediately begin preparing to roll the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) SLS rocket off of Launch Complex 39B and back to the VAB. The rocket and its mobile launch platform will ride NASA's crawler-transporter for the 4-mile journey.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-says-it-needs-to-haul-the-artemis-ii-rocket-back-to-the-hangar-for-repairs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When dinosaur fossils surface at a site, it is often not possible to tell how many millions of years ago their bones were buried. While the different strata of sedimentary rock represent periods of geologic history frozen in time, accurately dating them or the fossils trapped within them has frequently proven to be frustrating.</p>
<p>Fossilized bones and teeth have been dated with some success before, but that success is inconsistent and depends on the specimens. Both fossilization and the process of sediment turning to rock can alter the bone in ways that interfere with accuracy. While uranium-lead dating is among the most widely used methods for dating materials, it is just an emerging technology when applied to directly dating fossils.</p>
<p>Dinosaur eggshells might have finally cracked a way to date surrounding rocks and fossils. Led by paleontologist Ryan Tucker of Stellenbosch University, a team of researchers has devised a method of dating eggshells that reveals how long ago they were covered in what was once sand, mud, or other sediments. That information will give the burial time of any other fossils embedded in the same layer of rock.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/dinosaur-eggshells-can-reveal-the-age-of-other-fossils/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Daphne O. Martschenko and Sam Trejo both want to make the world a better, fairer, more equitable place. But they disagree on whether studying social genomics—elucidating any potential genetic contributions to behaviors ranging from mental illnesses to educational attainment to political affiliation—can help achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Martschenko’s argument is largely that genetic research and data have almost always been used thus far as a justification to further entrench extant social inequalities. But we know the solutions to many of the injustices in our world—trying to lift people out of poverty, for example—and we certainly don’t need more genetic research to implement them. Trejo’s point is largely that more information is generally better than less. We can’t foresee the benefits that could come from basic research, and this research is happening anyway, whether we like it or not, so we may as well try to harness it as best we can toward good and not ill.</p>
<p>Obviously, they’re both right. In <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691237756/what-we-inherit?srsltid=AfmBOorhEUDuvnbOtnDI2SD0N9tV6PpQbM-eSWIj2n1XsL2yvOCxkm3x"><i>What We Inherit: How New Technologies and Old Myths Are Shaping Our Genomic Future</i></a>, we get to see how their collaboration can shed light on our rapidly advancing genetic capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/have-we-leapt-into-commercial-genetic-testing-without-understanding-it/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Unlike the first attempt to load propellants into the SLS rocket on February 2, there were no major leaks during Thursday's practice countdown at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Technicians swapped seals at the launch pad after hydrogen gas leaked from the rocket's main fueling line earlier this month. This time, the seals held.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"For the most part, those fixes all performed pretty well yesterday," said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for NASA's exploration programs.

Asha Sharma, an executive currently in charge of Microsoft's CoreAI division, will take his place.</p>
<p>Xbox President Sarah Bond, who many assumed was being groomed as Spencer's eventual replacement, is also resigning from the company. Current Xbox Studios Head Matt Booty, meanwhile, is being promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer and will work closely with Sharma.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">his departure note</a>, Spencer said he told Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last fall that he was "thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life." Spencer will remain at Microsoft "in an advisory role" through the summer to help Sharma during the transition, he wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/microsoft-gaming-chief-phil-spencer-steps-down-after-38-years-with-company/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Shortly after Discord announced that all users will soon be defaulted to teen experiences until their ages are verified, the messaging platform faced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-faces-backlash-over-age-checks-after-data-breach-exposed-70000-ids/">immediate backlash</a>.</p>
<p>One of the major complaints was that Discord planned to collect more government IDs as part of its global age verification process. It shocked many that Discord would be so bold so soon after a third-party breach of a former age check partner's services recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/discord-says-hackers-stole-government-ids-of-70000-users/">exposed 70,000 Discord users' government IDs</a>.</p>
<p>Attempting to reassure users, Discord claimed that most users wouldn't have to show ID, instead relying on video selfies using AI to estimate ages, which raised separate privacy concerns. In the future, perhaps behavioral signals would override the need for age checks for most users, Discord suggested, seemingly downplaying the risk that sensitive data would be improperly stored.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-and-persona-end-partnership-after-shady-uk-age-test-sparks-outcry/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr today urged broadcasters to join a "Pledge America Campaign" that Carr established to support President Trump's "Salute to America 250" project.</p>
<p>Carr said in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-418890A1.pdf">press release</a> that "I am inviting broadcasters to pledge to air programming in their local markets in support of this historic national, non-partisan celebration." The press release said Carr is asking broadcasters to "air patriotic, pro-America programming in support of America’s 250th birthday."</p>
<p>Carr gave what he called examples of content that broadcasters can run if they take the pledge. His examples include "starting each broadcast day with the 'Star Spangled Banner' or Pledge of Allegiance"; airing "PSAs, short segments, or full specials specifically promoting civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history"; running "segments during regular news programming that highlight local sites that are significant to American and regional history, such as National Park Service sites"; airing "music by America’s greatest composers, such as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington, and George Gershwin"; and providing daily “Today in American History” announcements highlighting significant events from US history.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/fcc-asks-stations-for-pro-america-programming-like-daily-pledge-of-allegiance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Meta announced today that it will divorce its Horizon Worlds social and gaming service—once promoted as the company's first major step into the metaverse—from its Quest VR headset platform and digital store.</p>
<p>The company says it is now "shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile." The <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/2026-vr-state-of-the-union-horizon-mobile-focus/">announcement</a> is also filled with statements like "we're doubling down on the VR developer ecosystem" that are attempting to head off any suggestion that Meta is retreating from the mixed reality space.</p>
<p>This is far from the first signal that big changes are happening with Meta's mixed reality strategy. CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/metas-reality-labs-posts-6point02-billion-loss-in-fourth-quarter.html">reported</a> that Meta has lost $80 billion on investments in Reality Labs, the company's mixed reality division. More than 1,000 Reality Labs employees were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/meta-to-reportedly-lay-off-10-of-reality-labs-staff/">laid off</a> in January, but don't misread that as a total closure; more than 15,000 people were working in that part of the organization before the layoffs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/metas-flagship-metaverse-service-leaves-vr-behind/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Bhattacharya's new role comes amid a leadership shakeup in the Department of Health and Human Services under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also marks the third leader for the beleaguered public health agency under Kennedy.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The English-language edition of Wikipedia is blacklisting Archive.today after the controversial archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blog.</p>
<p>In the course of discussing whether Archive.today should be deprecated because of the DDoS, Wikipedia editors discovered that the archive site altered snapshots of webpages to insert the name of the blogger who was targeted by the DDoS. The alterations were apparently fueled by a grudge against the blogger over a post that described how the Archive.today maintainer hid their identity behind several aliases.</p>
<p>"There is consensus to immediately deprecate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive.today">archive.today</a>, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist (or create an edit filter that blocks adding new links), and remove all links to it," stated an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Archive.is_RFC_5">update</a> today on Wikipedia's Archive.today discussion. "There is a strong consensus that Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users' computers to run a DDoS attack (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ELNO#EL3">WP:ELNO#3</a>). Additionally, evidence has been presented that archive.today's operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-bans-archive-today-after-site-executed-ddos-and-altered-web-captures/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For a long time now, PC gamers have been used to the Final Fantasy series treating their platform as somewhat secondary to the game's core console versions. There are some signs that may be starting to change, though, as director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed that the PC is now the "lead platform" for development of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/">a recent interview with Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi clarified that the team takes the relatively common practice of creating visual assets for its multiplatform games by targeting "high-end environments first," then performing a "reduction" for less powerful platforms. These days, that means "our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation," he said. Players have already noticed this graphical difference in the PC version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, Hamaguchi said, and "our philosophy will not change for the third installment."</p>
<p>While PC gaming is only "gradually expanding in Japan," Hamaguchi said the rapid growth in international PC gamers has led the company to "develop assets with the broad PC market in mind."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/why-final-fantasy-is-now-targeting-pc-as-its-lead-platform/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Two skulls from Yunxian, in northern China, aren’t ancestors of Denisovans after all; they’re actually the oldest known <i>Homo erectus</i> fossils in eastern Asia.</p>
<p>A recent study has re-dated the skulls to about 1.77 million years old, which makes them the oldest hominin remains found so far in East Asia. Their age means that <i>Homo erectus</i> (an extinct common ancestor of our species, Neanderthals, and Denisovans) must have spread across the continent much earlier and much faster than we’d previously given them credit for. It also sheds new light on who was making stone tools at some even older archaeological sites in China.</p>
<h2><b><i>Homo erectus</i> spread like wildfire</b></h2>
<p>Yunxian is an important—and occasionally contentious—archaeological site on the banks of central China’s Han River. Along with hundreds of stone tools and animal bones, the layers of river sediment have yielded three nearly complete hominin skulls (only two of which have been described in a publication so far). Shantou University paleoanthropologist Hua Tu and his colleagues measured the ratio of two isotopes, aluminum-26 and beryllium-10, in grains of quartz from the sediment layer that once held the skulls. The results suggest that <i>Homo erectus</i> lived and died along the Han River 1.77 million years ago. That's just 130,000 years after the species first appeared in Africa.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/new-dates-on-chinese-fossils-raise-question-of-how-many-times-we-left-africa/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>With HBO's critically acclaimed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-trailer-brings-levity-to-westeros/"><em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em></a> gearing up for its season finale on Sunday, it's time to check in on that other <em>Game of Thrones</em> spinoff: the far darker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>, which now has a suitably ominous teaser for its upcoming third season.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first two seasons below.)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tensions-rise-between-targaryens-in-first-teaser-for-house-of-the-dragon-s2/">The series is set</a> nearly 200 years before the events of <em>Game of Thrones, </em>when dragons were still a fixture of Westeros, and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen’s reign. The primary source material is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-uri="1e4524e735173b30ff50f2f666a28acc"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a>, a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/its-outright-war-for-the-iron-throne-in-house-of-the-dragon-s3-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Games appear to be mostly unmodified ports of the well-regarded remakes.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>For my money, the 2004 Game Boy Advance re-releases of <em>Pokémon FireRed </em>and <em>LeafGreen</em> are still the best versions of the original <em>Pokémon</em> games. They fixed most of the bugs and balance issues present in the originals—partly by also including the rosters from <em>Gold</em>/<em>Silver</em> and <em>Ruby</em>/<em>Sapphire</em>—but they're more faithful to the original gameplay, battling and catching mechanics, and graphics than the 2018 <em>Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee!</em> adaptations for the Switch.</p>
<p>Someone at Nintendo apparently agrees, as the company <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/the-pokemon-firered-version-and-pokemon-leafgreen-version-games-are-releasing-on-nintendo-switch?cid=&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=vg&amp;utm_term=frlgnswitch">announced today</a> that it's re-releasing those games for the original Switch (and, by extension, the Switch 2, though no Switch 2-specific features were announced). The games will be available after a planned <em>Pokémon Presents</em> stream at 9 am Eastern/6 am Pacific on February 27.</p>
<p>Subscribers to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/online/nintendo-switch-online/expansion-pack/">Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> are in for a disappointment, though. Instead of releasing <em>FireRed </em>and <em>LeafGreen </em>as part of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/a-quick-look-at-the-switchs-new-game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-emulation/">Switch Online Game Boy Advance</a> collection, Nintendo will release both titles as standalone purchases that will run you $20 apiece. This means that players without a subscription will be able to buy and play the games. But given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Classics#Game_Boy_Advance">how few GBA games are available</a> for the Switch Online service and how infrequently new ones are released, it does rankle to see otherwise unmodified ports of a prominent game bypass subscribers entirely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/pokemon-red-and-greens-gba-remakes-are-getting-re-released-on-switch-for-20-a-pop/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last night, Tesla made some hefty cuts to Cybertruck pricing in an effort to stimulate some sales. The bombastic tri-motor "Cyberbeast" is $15,000 cheaper at $99,990, albeit by dropping some previously free features like supercharging and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-fsd-gets-worse-at-driving-nhtsa-opens-new-investigation/">FSD</a>. And there's now a new $59,990 entry-level model, a dual-motor configuration with a range of 325 miles (523 km) and the same 4.1-second 0–60 mph (0-97 km/h) time as the $79,990 premium all-wheel drive version.</p>
<p>That actually makes the new entry-level model a good deal, at least in terms of Cybertrucks. Last year, the company <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a66102567/tesla-cybertruck-rear-wheel-drive-canceled/">introduced and then eliminated</a> a single-motor rear-wheel drive variant, which found few takers when priced at $69,990; an extra motor for $10,000 less is quite a savings, and actually slightly cheaper than the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/the-cheapest-tesla-cybertruck-is-99990-promised-60k-model-canceled/">price originally advertised for the RWD truck</a>.</p>
<p>As you might expect, Tesla has made some changes to get down to the new price. The range and 0–60 mph time might be the same as the more expensive dual-motor Cybertruck, but towing capacity is reduced from 11,000 lbs (4,990 kg) to 7,000 lbs (3,175kg), and cargo capacity drops from 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) to 2,006 lbs (910 kg).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/tesla-slashes-cybertruck-prices-as-it-tries-to-move-unpainted-metal/">Read full article</a></p>
