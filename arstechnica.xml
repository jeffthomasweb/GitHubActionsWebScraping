<p>Ray spiders deploy an unusual strategy to capture prey in their webs. They essentially pull it back into a cone shape and release it when prey approaches, trapping said prey in the sticky silken threads. A few years ago, scientists noticed that they could get the spiders to release their webs just by snapping their fingers nearby, suggesting that the spiders relied at least in part on sound vibrations to know when to strike. Evidence for that hypothesis has now been confirmed in a <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.249237">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.</p>
<p>Most spider orb webs are static: the spiders weave them and fix them in place and then wait for prey to fly into the webs. That causes the silk threads to vibrate, alerting the spider that dinner is served. There are some species that actively actuate their webs, however, per the authors.</p>
<p>For instance, the triangle weaver spring-loads its triangular web once an insect has made contact so that the threads wrap around the prey in fractions of a second. Bolas spiders seem to detect prey in their vicinity through auditory cues, throwing a line of silk with a sticky end at passing moths to catch them. Ogre-faced spiders also seem to be able to hear potential prey, striking backward with a small silk net held in their front legs. It's a more proactive hunting strategy than merely waiting for prey to fly into a web.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/these-spiders-listen-for-prey-before-hurling-webs-like-slingshots/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Our relationship with wolves, dogs, and even coyotes has always been complicated.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Between 8,000 and 12,000 years ago, people in Alaska kept reinventing dogs with mixed results.</p>
<p>The dogs that share our homes today are the descendants of a single group of wolves that lived in Siberia about 23,000 years ago. But for thousands of years after that split, the line between wolf and dog wasn’t quite clear-cut. A recent study shows that long after dogs had spread into Eurasia and the Americas, people living in what is now Alaska still spent time with—and fed—a bizarre mix of dogs, wolves, dog-wolf hybrids, and even some coyotes.</p>
<h2>We just can’t stop feeding the wildlife</h2>
<p>University of Arizona archaeologist François Lanoë and his colleagues studied 111 sets of bones from dogs and wolves from archaeological sites across the Alaskan interior. The oldest bones came from wolves that roamed what’s now Alaska long before people set foot there, and the most recent came from modern, wild Alaskan wolves. In between, the researchers worked with the remains of both wolves and dogs (and even a couple of coyotes) that spanning a swath of time from about 1,000 to around 14,000 years ago. And it turns out that even the wolves were tangled up in the lives of nearby humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/dog-domestication-happened-many-times-but-most-didnt-pan-out/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A US government security official urged Americans to use encrypted messaging as major telecom companies struggle to evict Chinese hackers from their networks. The attack has been attributed to a Chinese hacking group called Salt Typhoon.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/reports-china-hacked-verizon-and-att-may-have-accessed-us-wiretap-systems/">reports since early October</a> that Chinese government hackers penetrated the networks of telecoms and may have gained access to systems used for court-authorized wiretaps of communications networks. Impacted telcos reportedly include Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Lumen (also known as CenturyLink).</p>
<p>T-Mobile has said its own network wasn't hacked but that it severed a connection it had to a different provider whose network was hacked. Lumen has said it has no evidence that customer data on its network was accessed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/us-recommends-encrypted-messaging-as-chinese-hackers-linger-in-telecom-networks/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon has been accused of secretly slowing down Prime deliveries in low-income parts of the District of Columbia and then lying to customers who complained.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DC-v-Amazon-Complaint-12-4-24.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed on Wednesday, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb alleged that Amazon violated a local consumer protection law by overcharging approximately 48,000 "historically underserved" people in "two ZIP codes east of the Anacostia River"—20019 and 20020—by millions after "secretly" changing how delivery services work in these areas.</p>
<p>According to Schwalb's <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/release/attorney-general-schwalb-sues-amazon-secretly">press release</a>, Amazon switched from using its in-house delivery service for the last mile of deliveries to these DC ZIP codes sometime in mid-2022 to "exclusively" using third-party services. These third-party services—such as USPS or UPS—are "often slower" than Amazon delivery drivers, and "Amazon knew" the switch "would result in significantly slower deliveries for residents living in these two ZIP codes yet it never informed existing or prospective Prime members living there of that exclusion," the release said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/amazon-secretly-slowed-deliveries-deceived-anyone-who-complained-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>To fill a car with gas, you generally just need a credit card or cash. To charge an EV at a DC fast charging station, you need any number of things to work—a credit card reader, an app for that charger's network, a touchscreen that's working—and they're all a little different.</p>
<p>That situation could change next year if <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sae-industry-technologies-consortia-and-joint-office-of-energy-and-transportation-advance-universal-plug--charge-302321856.html">a new "universal Plug and Charge" initiative</a> from SAE International, backed by a number of EV carmakers and chargers, moves ahead and gains ground. Launching in early 2025, the network could make charging an EV actually easier than gassing up: plug in, let the car and charger figure out the payment details over a cloud connection, and go.</p>
<p>Some car and charging network combinations already offer such a system through a patchwork of individual deals, as <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/714654/evs-plug-charge-capable/">listed at Inside EVs</a>. Teslas have always offered a plug-and-charge experience, given the tight integration between their Superchargers and vehicles. Now Tesla will join the plug-and-charge movement proper, allowing Teslas to have a roughly similar experience at other stations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/universal-plug-and-charge-for-most-evs-is-moving-ahead-for-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>By some measures, AI systems <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/ai-outperforms-conventional-weather-forecasting-for-the-first-time-google-study/">are now competitive with traditional computing methods</a> for generating weather forecasts. Because their training penalizes errors, however, the forecasts tend to get "blurry"—as you move further ahead in time, the models make fewer specific predictions since those are more likely to be wrong. As a result, you start to see things like storm tracks broadening and the storms themselves losing clearly defined edges.</p>
<p>But using AI is still extremely tempting because the alternative is a computational atmospheric circulation model, which is extremely compute-intensive. Still, it's highly successful, with the ensemble model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts considered the best in class.</p>
<p>In a paper being released today, Google's DeepMind claims its new AI system manages to outperform the European model on forecasts out to at least a week and often beyond. DeepMind's system, called GenCast, merges some computational approaches used by atmospheric scientists with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-generative-ai-revolution-has-begun-how-did-we-get-here/">diffusion model</a>, commonly used in generative AI. The result is a system that maintains high resolution while cutting the computational cost significantly.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/googles-deepmind-tackles-weather-forecasting-with-great-performance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For most people, Windows 10 security updates are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/lots-of-pcs-are-poised-to-fall-off-the-windows-10-update-cliff-one-year-from-today/">slated to stop on October 14, 2025</a>, just over 10 months from today. That could end up being a serious security problem, given that Windows 10 is still the version used by a large majority of the world's PCs.</p>
<p>Users will be able to buy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/home-users-can-only-buy-one-year-of-extra-windows-10-updates-for-30-per-pc/">a one-year reprieve for $30</a>, and businesses and other organizations will have the option to pay for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/windows-10-gets-three-more-years-of-security-updates-if-you-can-afford-them/">two more years after that</a>. But the easiest and cheapest way out of the problem—an upgrade to Windows 11, which is still free for Windows 10 PCs that can run it—still remains out of reach for many active PCs because of Windows 11's more stringent system requirements.</p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/tpm-2-0-%e2%80%93-a-necessity-for-a-secure-and-future-proof-windows-11/4339066">has reiterated this week</a> that it has no plans to loosen those requirements to boost Windows 11's adoption numbers, focusing particularly on the need for a TPM 2.0 device. Short for Trusted Platform Module, a TPM stores encryption keys and performs other cryptographic functions, and Windows uses it to seamlessly decrypt your PC's disk at boot, among other things. A TPM 2.0 module is a "non-negotiable" requirement for boosting Windows 11's security baseline, says Microsoft, and that apparently won't be changing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/microsoft-reiterates-non-negotiable-tpm-2-0-requirement-for-windows-11/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the key differences between Apple's Macs and the iPhone and iPad is that the Mac can still boot and run non-Apple operating systems. This is a feature that Apple specifically built for the Mac, one of many features meant to ease the transition from Intel's chips to Apple's own silicon.</p>
<p>The problem, at least at first, was that alternate operating systems like Windows and Linux didn't work natively with Apple's hardware, not least because of missing drivers for basic things like USB ports, GPUs, and power management. Enter the Asahi Linux project, a community-driven effort to make open-source software run on Apple's hardware.</p>
<p>In just a few years, the team has taken Linux on Apple Silicon from "basically bootable" to "plays native Windows games and sounds great doing it." And the team's ultimate goal is to contribute enough code upstream that you no longer need a Linux distribution just for Apple Silicon Macs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/12/join-us-tomorrow-for-ars-live-how-asahi-linux-ports-open-software-to-apples-hardware/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In late September, seagrass ecologist Alyssa Novak pulled on her neoprene wetsuit, pressed her snorkel mask against her face, and jumped off an oyster farming boat into the shallow waters of Pleasant Bay, an estuary in the Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts. Through her mask she gazed toward the sandy seabed, about 3 feet below the surface at low tide, where she was about to plant an experimental underwater garden of eelgrass.</p>
<p>Naturally occurring meadows of eelgrass—the most common type of seagrass found along the East Coast of the United States—are vanishing. Like seagrasses around the world, they have been plagued for decades by dredging, disease, and nutrient pollution from wastewater and agricultural runoff. The nutrient overloads have fueled algal blooms and clouded coastal waters with sediments, blocking out sunlight the marine plants need to make food through photosynthesis and suffocating them.</p>
<p>The United Nations Environment Program <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/protection-seagrasses-key-building-resilience-climate-change">reports</a> more than 20 of the world’s 72 seagrass species are on the decline.

              <![CDATA[<p>A system of non-competition clauses enforced by the European Space Agency’s (ESA) workforce suppliers is allegedly trapping aerospace professionals who work at ESA’s facilities across Europe in a professional dead-end street. Their contracts prevent job mobility and the possibility to earn better pay, a large number of contractors have alleged to Ars Technica. And as nations that host ESA facilities have enacted laws that give some contractors greater rights, the ESA itself has adopted a policy that will shift more of its indirect employees to service positions, which would not be protected by these laws.</p>
<p>When asked about these issues, an ESA spokesperson said there are “employment conditions in which ESA is not to interfere” and that non-competition clauses “remain within the remit of the employer and the employee.”</p>
<p>The European Space Agency, Europe’s version of NASA, is an intergovernmental organization comprising 22 member states. With facilities in six European countries, the agency relies on contractors—scientists, engineers, and admin workers—hired through payroll companies. These contractors, who work alongside ESA’s staff on the agency’s space projects, constitute over half of the agency’s workforce, according to available estimates.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/esa-workers-face-a-maze-of-non-compete-clauses-and-service-contracts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The week before Thanksgiving, Marshall Brain sent a final email to his colleagues at North Carolina State University. "I have just been through one of the most demoralizing, depressing, humiliating, unjust processes possible with the university," wrote the founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HowStuffWorks">HowStuffWorks.com</a> and director of NC State's Engineering Entrepreneurs Program. Hours later, campus police found that Brain had died by suicide.</p>
<p>NC State police discovered Brain unresponsive in Engineering Building II on Centennial Campus around 7 am on November 20, following a welfare check request from his wife at 6:40 am, according to <a href="https://www.technicianonline.com/news/popular-nc-state-professor-marshall-brain-dies-alleges-retaliation-for-ethics-complaints/article_152e5c80-ac2e-11ef-8b3f-036ac3c8d9bf.html">The Technician</a>, NC State's student newspaper. Police confirmed Brain was deceased when they arrived.</p>
<p>Brian Gordon, a reporter for <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article296186159.html">The News and Observer</a> in Raleigh, obtained a copy of Brain's death certificate and shared it with Ars Technica, confirming the suicide. It marks an abrupt end to a life rich with achievement and the joy of spreading technical knowledge to others.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/web-pioneer-marshall-brain-dies-suddenly-at-63-amid-ethics-battle/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Russian court has issued a life sentence to a man found guilty of being the kingpin of a dark web drug marketplace that supplied more than a metric ton of narcotics and psychotropic substances to customers around the world.</p>
<p>On Monday, the court found that Stanislav Moiseyev oversaw Hydra, a Russian-language market that operated an anonymous website that matched sellers of drugs and other illicit wares with buyers. Hydra was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/04/hydra-the-worlds-biggest-cybercrime-forum-shut-down-in-police-sting/">dismantled in 2022</a> after authorities in Germany seized servers and other infrastructure used by the sprawling billion-dollar enterprise and a stash of bitcoin worth millions of dollars. At the time, Hydra was the largest crime forum, having facilitated $5 billion in transactions for 17 million customers. The market had been in operation since 2015.</p>
<h2>One-stop cybercrime shop</h2>
<p>“The court established that from 2015 to October 2018, the criminal community operated in various regions of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus,” the state prosecutor’s office of the Moscow Region <a href="https://epp.genproc.gov.ru/web/proc_50/mass-media/news?item=99442998">said</a>. “The well-covered activities of the organized criminal group were aimed at systematically committing serious and especially serious crimes related to the illegal trafficking of drugs and psychotropic substances.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/russian-court-sentences-kingpin-of-hydra-drug-marketplace-to-life-in-prison/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's nothing quite like a deep dive into the shallow, vomitous puddles of children's splash pads. Even toeing the edge is enough to have one longing for the unsettling warmth of a kiddie pool. But the brave souls at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have done it, wading into 25 years' worth of records on gastrointestinal outbreaks linked to the wellsprings of fecal pathogens. And they unsurprisingly found enough retch-inducing results to make any modern-day <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Snow-British-physician">John Snows</a> want to start removing some water handles.</p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2022, splash pads across the country were linked to at least 60 outbreaks, with the largest sickening over 2,000 water frolickers in one go. In all, the outbreaks led to at least 10,611 illnesses, 152 hospitalizations, and 99 emergency department visits. People, mostly children, were sickened with pathogens including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/hard-to-kill-poop-parasites-that-lurk-in-swimming-pools-on-the-rise-cdc-warns/"><em>Cryptosporidium</em></a>,<em> Camplyobacter jejuni, Giardia duodenalis, Salmonella, Shigella, </em>and norovirus, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/ss/ss7308a1.htm?s_cid=ss7308a1_w">the analysis, published Tuesday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</a>. The tallies of outbreaks and illnesses are likely undercounts, given reporting delays and missed connections.</p>
<p>Though previous <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/fecal-fountains-cdc-warns-of-diarrheal-outbreaks-linked-to-poopy-splash-pads/">outbreak-based studies</a> have provided bursts of data, the new analysis is the first to provide a comprehensive catalog of all the documented outbreaks since splash pads erupted in the 1990s. Together, they provide a clear, stomach-churning explanation of how the outbreaks keep happening. Basically, small children go into the watery playgrounds while they're sick and spread their germs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/from-diapers-to-mouths-of-babes-how-splash-pads-sickened-over-10k/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An app outage that locked numerous rental car customers out of their vehicles is a reminder of the perils of completely relying on apps for basic functionality—especially when those apps have seemingly limited support resources.</p>
<p>Zipcar is a car-sharing service that lets customers pay a membership fee to rent vehicles. Members use the Zipcar app to locate cars, unlock and lock them, share images of the vehicle (for proof that you didn't damage it), and report concerns. One typically goes through the entire Zipcar rental process without interacting with a human. Avoiding car rental lines and customer service representatives seems efficient until the app utterly fails you.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-total-meltdown-black-friday-zipcar-outage-strands-customers-in-random-places/">404 Media</a> today, Zipcar experienced an outage on Friday that prevented the app from functioning properly for numerous users. Without the app support, people could not unlock cars to start rentals, open cars that didn't come with keys, lock cars, and/or return cars before their rental period expired.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nightmare-zipcar-outage-is-a-warning-against-complete-app-dependency/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Both are decidedly midrange graphics cards that will compete with the likes of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 and AMD's RX 7600 series, but Intel is pricing them competitively: $249 for a B580 with 12GB of RAM and $219 for a B570 with 10GB of RAM. The B580 launches on December 13, while the B570 won't be available until January 16.</p>
<p>The two cards are Intel's first dedicated GPUs based on its next-generation "Battlemage" architecture, a successor to the "Alchemist" architecture used in the A-series cards. Intel's Core Ultra 200 laptop processors were its first products to ship with Battlemage, though they used an integrated version with fewer of Intel's Xe cores and no dedicated memory. Both B-series GPUs use silicon manufactured on a 5 nm TSMC process, an upgrade from the 6 nm process used for the A-series; as of this writing, no integrated <em>or</em> dedicated Arc GPUs have been manufactured by one of Intel's factories.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/intel-targets-budget-friendly-1440p-gaming-with-249-and-219-arc-b500-gpus/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>My desk is not clean, but I know why everything is on it. It is inefficient if you are not me and are trying to find things or make sense of it. If you know where to look, like I do, however, every piece is doing a particular job.</p>
<p>If you're like me, or know someone like me, you know desk space is at a premium—not to keep it tidy and empty, but to fill it with even more junk. With this in mind, I have compiled some of the items I either own and cherish, or have saved to various online carts and considered many times. These gadgets keep devices powered, items labeled, the office space conveniently automated, and cables always within arm's reach. With all the space and mental stress these gadgets can and do save me, I have so much more room for, say, reading about Oscar Levant and putting empty seltzer cans everywhere.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/favorite-desk-accessories/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On April 15, 2019, the world watched in transfixed horror as a fire ravaged the famed Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, collapsing the spire and melting the lead roof. After years of painstaking restoration costing around $740 million, the cathedral reopens to the public this weekend. The December issue of National Geographic features <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/notre-dame-cathedral-restoration-reopening">an exclusive look</a> inside the restored cathedral, accompanied by striking photographs by Paris-based photographer and visual artist Tomas van Houtryve.</p>
<p>For several hours, it seemed as if the flames would utterly destroy the 800-year-old cathedral. But after a long night of work by more than 400 Paris firefighters, the fire finally began to cool and attention began to shift to what could be salvaged and rebuilt. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to restore Notre Dame to its former glory and set a five-year deadline. The COVID-19 pandemic caused some delays, but France nearly met that deadline regardless.</p>
<p>Those reconstruction efforts were helped by the fact that, a few years before the fire, scientist <a href="https://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/sah-newsletter/sah-newsletter-ind/2018/12/06/obituary-prof.-andrew-j.-tallon-1969-2018">Andrew Tallon</a> had used laser scanning to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/laser-scans-could-help-rebuild-notre-dame-cathedral/587230/">create precisely detailed maps</a> of the interior and exterior of the cathedral—an invaluable aid as Paris rebuilds this landmark structure. French acousticians had also made detailed measurements of Notre Dame's "soundscape" that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/acoustic-maps-of-notre-dame-could-help-recreate-the-cathedrals-soundscape/">were instrumental</a> in helping architects factor acoustics into their reconstruction plans. The resulting model even enabled Brian FG Katz, research director of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) at Sorbonne University, to create a <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4987161?dm_i=3Q4Y,KLEO,J2QTD,286II,1">virtual reality version</a> of Notre Dame with all the acoustical parameters in place.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/a-peek-inside-the-restoration-of-the-iconic-notre-dame-cathedral/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Steam Link was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/steams-living-room-hardware-blitz-gets-off-to-a-muddy-start/#page-3">a little box ahead of its time</a>. It streamed games from a PC to a TV, ran 1,500 0f them natively, offered a strange (if somewhat lovable) little controller, and essentially required a great network, Ethernet cables, and a good deal of fiddling.</p>
<p>Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/valve-quietly-discontinues-steam-link-hardware-production/">quietly discontinued the Steam Link gear in November 2018</a>, but it didn't give up. These days, a Steam Link app can be found on most platforms, and Valve's sustained effort to move Linux-based (i.e., non-Windows-controlled) gaming forward has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">paid real dividends</a>. If you still want a dedicated device to stream Steam games, however? A Raspberry Pi 5 (with some help from Valve) can be a Substitute Steam Link.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/valves-steam-link-on-raspberry-pi/">detailed in the Raspberry Pi blog</a>, there were previously means of getting Steam Link working on Raspberry Pi devices, but the platform's move away from proprietary Broadcom libraries—and from X to Wayland display systems—required "a different approach." <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/slouken">Sam Lantinga from Valve</a> worked with the Raspberry Pi team on optimizing for the Raspberry Pi 5 hardware. As of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/4629231777834100224/">Steam Link 1.3.13</a> for the little board, Raspberry Pi 5 units could support up to 1080p at 144 frames per second (FPS) on the H.264 protocol and 4k at 60 FPS or 1080p at 240 FPS, presuming your primary gaming computer and network can support that.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-raspberry-pi-5-now-works-as-a-smaller-faster-kind-of-steam-link/">Read full article</a></p>
