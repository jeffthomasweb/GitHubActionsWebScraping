                            <![CDATA[<p>In southwest Arkansas, the state government runs what might be the world's most unusual diamond mine. For the price of a movie ticket, anyone can dig for diamonds at <a href="https://www.arkansasstateparks.com/parks/crater-diamonds-state-park">Crater of Diamonds State Park</a>—and keep whatever they find.</p>
<p>The 37-acre search field near Murfreesboro sits atop an ancient volcanic pipe that erupted roughly 100 million years ago. That eruption brought diamonds that <a href="https://geology.com/articles/diamonds-from-coal/">formed</a> deep within the Earth's mantle to the surface, where they now wait in the soil for anyone with a garden trowel and patience.</p>
<p>The Crater of Diamonds site hosted multiple commercial mining attempts between 1906 (when <a href="https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/john-wesley-huddleston-4732/">John Wesley Huddleston</a> found the first diamonds) and the park's opening in 1972. Several companies tried to make the operation profitable but failed due to the relatively low concentration of diamonds compared to commercial mines elsewhere.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/for-15-anyone-can-dig-up-diamonds-in-this-arkansas-state-park/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal appeals court rejected T-Mobile's attempt to overturn $92 million in fines for selling customer location information to third-party firms.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission last year <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-fines-big-three-carriers-196m-for-selling-users-real-time-location-data/">fined T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon</a>, saying the carriers illegally shared access to customers' location information without consent and did not take reasonable measures to protect that sensitive data against unauthorized disclosure. The fines relate to sharing of real-time location data that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/verizon-and-att-will-stop-selling-your-phones-location-to-data-brokers/">revealed in 2018</a>, but it took years for the FCC to finalize the penalties.</p>
<p>The three carriers appealed the rulings in three different courts, and the first major decision was handed down Friday. A three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2025/08/24-1224-2130255.pdf">ruled unanimously</a> against T-Mobile and its subsidiary Sprint.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/t-mobile-claimed-selling-location-data-without-consent-is-legal-judges-disagree/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Media Matters for America (MMFA)—a nonprofit that Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/elon-musk-sues-media-matters-despite-admitting-x-paired-ads-with-nazi-content/">accused of sparking a supposedly illegal ad boycott on X</a>—won its bid to block a sweeping Federal Trade Commission (FTC) probe that appeared to have rushed to silence Musk's foe without ever adequately explaining why the government needed to get involved.</p>
<p>In her opinion granting MMFA's preliminary injunction, US District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan—a Joe Biden appointee—<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MMFA-v-FTC-Opinion-8-15-25.pdf">agreed</a> that the FTC's probe was likely to be ruled as a retaliatory violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Warning that the FTC's targeting of reporters was particularly concerning, Sooknanan wrote that the "case presents a straightforward First Amendment violation," where it's reasonable to conclude that conservative FTC staffers were perhaps motivated to eliminate a media organization dedicated to correcting conservative misinformation online.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/elon-musks-thermonuclear-media-matters-lawsuit-may-be-fizzling-out/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On August 6, the China Manned Space Agency successfully tested a high-fidelity mockup of its 26-ton "Lanyue" lunar lander. The test, conducted outside of Beijing, used giant tethers to simulate lunar gravity as the vehicle fired main engines and fine control thrusters to land on a cratered surface and take off from there.</p>
<p>"The test," <a href="https://english.spacechina.com/n17212/c4399581/content.html">said the agency in an official statement</a>, "represents a key step in the development of China's manned lunar exploration program, and also marks the first time that China has carried out a test of extraterrestrial landing and takeoff capabilities of a manned spacecraft."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/after-recent-tests-china-appears-likely-to-beat-the-united-states-back-to-the-moon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration's plans to improve Americans' health will include a push to review the safety of electromagnetic radiation, echoing long-held conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Wi-Fi and 5G touted by health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/15/draft-maha-strategy-trump-kennedy-00511169">Politico</a> obtained a <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000198-adc3-d0bd-a1db-bfdb703d0000">draft version of the "Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy,"</a> a highly anticipated report from the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission intended to steer the administration's health policy. The report, which has not been adopted by the White House, is being viewed as friendly to industry, and it contains little to no policy recommendations or proposed regulations. For instance, it includes no proposed restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, which are top priorities of the MAHA movement.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the document mainly rehashes the talking points and priorities of Kennedy's health crusades. That includes attacking water fluoridation, casting doubt on the safety of childhood vaccines, pushing for more physical activity in children to reduce chronic diseases, getting rid of synthetic food dyes, and claiming that children are being overprescribed medications.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/maha-draft-takes-on-electromagnetic-radiation-echoing-rfk-jr-s-conspiracies/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The folks at Raspberry Pi have announced a new touchscreen component for people using boards to create miniature touchscreen appliances: The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-5-variant-of-raspberry-pi-touch-display-2/">5-inch Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2</a> is a 720p IPS multi-touch screen that's natively supported by the Raspberry Pi OS and includes mounting holes on the back to make it easy to build integrated all-in-one devices.</p>
<p>The new screen will cost $40 and is available starting today from Pi resellers like <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-touch-display-2-5-inch.html?cid=USD&amp;src=raspberrypi">CanaKit</a>, <a href="https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display-2-5-portrait?src=raspberrypi">Vilros</a>, and <a href="https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-5-touch-display-2-portrait/?src=raspberrypi">PiShop</a> (though some of those retailers already list it slightly above the MSRP).</p>
<p>"Its capacitive touch screen works out of the box with full Linux driver support—no manual calibration required, no hunting through device trees, and no wrestling with incompatible touch controllers," writes Raspberry Pi software CTO Gordon Hollingworth <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-5-variant-of-raspberry-pi-touch-display-2/">in the company's blog post</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/raspberry-pi-intros-new-5-inch-40-touchscreen-for-your-next-weird-project/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>Ostensibly, C:\ArsGames is to some extent about actually driving a few game purchases, but in reality it's mostly an excuse for me and my colleagues to wax nostalgic about the games that were formative for us. Case in point: This entry in our ongoing series with GOG is about a game that's completely free. I think Ars can withstand this tiny revenue shortfall for the sake of peak nostalgia!</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons I chose <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe_elder_scrolls_chapter_ii_daggerfall"><em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em></a> this time around: its co-creator, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/julian-lefay-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-passed-away-at-59/">Julian LeFay, recently passed away</a>, so it seemed timely. Also, it was one of the defining games of my youth—one I have continued to revisit now and then.</p>
<p>But it's also interesting because of where its developer, Bethesda—a studio people both love and hate—is at today. Going back to <em>Daggerfall</em>, we find a game that shows off so much of what we've lost from the bygone era of '90s PC gaming, but also one that makes it abundantly clear why the industry left those sensibilities behind.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/a-question-for-the-ages-is-the-elder-scrolls-ii-daggerfall-a-good-game/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I go longer than I intend without writing an updated version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/ars-technica-system-guide-falling-prices-are-more-exciting-than-new-parts/">our PC building guide</a>. And while I could just claim to be too busy to spend hours on Newegg or Amazon or other sites digging through dozens of near-identical parts, the lack of updates <em>usually </em>correlates with "times when building a desktop PC is actually a pain in the ass."</p>
<p>Through most of 2025, fluctuating and inflated graphics card pricing and limited availability have once again conspired to make a normally fun hobby an annoying slog—and honestly kind of a bad way to spend your money, relative to just buying a Steam Deck or something and ignoring your desktop for a while.</p>
<p>But three things have brought me back for another round. First, GPU pricing and availability have improved a <em>little</em> since early 2025. Second, as unreasonable as pricing is for PC parts, pre-built PCs with worse specs and other design compromises are unreasonably priced, too, and people should have some sense of what their options are. And third, I just have the <em>itch</em>—it's been a while since I built (or helped someone else build) a PC, and I need to get it out of my system.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/ars-technica-system-guide-back-to-pc-building-for-back-to-school/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every dog owner knows that canines are natural scavengers and that vigilance is required to ensure they don't eat toxic substances. But accidental ingestions still happen—like the Chihuahua who vets discovered had somehow managed to ingest a significant quantity of cocaine, according to a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2025.1622850/full">case study</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science.</p>
<p>There have been several studies investigating the bad effects cocaine can have on the cardiovascular systems of both humans and animals. However, these controlled studies are primarily done in laboratory settings and often don't match the messier clinical realities. "Case reports are crucial in veterinary medicine by providing real-world examples," <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/08/18/what-do-dog-ingests-cocaine">said co-author Jake Johnson</a> of North Carolina State University. "They capture clinical scenarios that larger studies might miss, preserve unusual presentations for future reference, and help build our collective understanding of rare presentations, ultimately improving emergency preparedness and treatment protocols."</p>
<p>In the case of a 2-year-old male Chihuahua, the dog presented as lethargic and unresponsive. His owners had found him with his tongue sticking out and unable to focus visually. The Chihuahua was primarily an outdoor dog but was also allowed inside, and all its vaccines were up to date. Examination revealed bradycardia, i.e., a slow heart rate, a blue tinge to the dog's mucus membranes—often a sign of too much unoxygenated hemoglobin circulating through the system—and dilated pupils. The dog's symptoms faded after the vet administered a large dose of atropine, followed by epinephrine.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/the-case-of-the-coke-snorting-chihauhua/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show"><em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em></a> premiered in 1975, no one could have dreamed that it would become the longest-running theatrical release film in history. But that's what happened. Thanks to a killer soundtrack, campy humor, and a devoted cult following, <em>Rocky Horror</em> is still a mainstay of midnight movie culture. In honor of its 50th anniversary, Disney/20th Century Studios is releasing a newly restored 4K HDR version in October, along with deluxe special editions on DVD and Blu-ray. And the film has inspired not one, but two documentaries marking its five decades of existence: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Journey:_The_Story_of_Rocky_Horror"><em>Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror</em></a> and <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5733218/">Sane Inside Insanity: The Phenomenon of Rocky Horror</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below, because it's been 50 years.)</strong></p>
<p>The film is an adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_O%27Brien">Richard O'Brien</a>'s 1973 musical for the stage, <em>The Rocky Horror Show</em>. At the time, he was a struggling actor and wrote the musical as an homage to the science fiction and B horror movies he'd loved since a child. In fact, the opening song ("<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKhPVHoodrU">Science Fiction/Double Feature</a>") makes explicit reference to many of those, including 1951's <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em>,<em> Flash Gordon</em> (1936), <em>King Kong</em> (1933), <em>The Invisible Man</em> (1933), <em>Forbidden Planet</em> (1956), and <em>The Day of the Triffids</em> (1962), among others.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/celebrating-50-years-of-the-rocky-horror-picture-show/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After several days of working its way across the open and at times hostile Atlantic Ocean this week, Hurricane Erin found more favorable conditions and exploded in intensity on Friday night. Shortly before noon on Saturday, the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCUAT5+shtml/161520.shtml">National Hurricane Center declared</a> that Erin had reached Category 5 status, the most powerful kind of hurricane.</p>
<p>This determination is based on sustained winds, which were measured by a US Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft on Saturday at 160 mph.</p>
<p>There is some good news: Erin is threading a needle with its projected track. Although it should pass close to several landmasses between now and next Thursday, Erin should remain far enough away to avoid catastrophic damage. Erin is presently passing to the north of the Caribbean islands and will turn northward before reaching the Bahamas and the Eastern United States. Later next week it should follow a path that takes it between Atlantic Canada and Bermuda.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/hurricane-erin-sets-early-season-intensification-record-becomes-category-5-storm/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Everything we see around us, from the ground beneath our feet to the most remote galaxies, is made of matter. For scientists, that has long posed a problem: According to physicists’ best current theories, matter and its counterpart, antimatter, ought to have been created in equal amounts at the time of the Big Bang. But antimatter is vanishingly rare in the universe. So what happened?</p>
<p>Physicists don’t know the answer to that question yet, but many think the solution must involve some subtle difference in the way that matter and antimatter behave. And right now, the most promising path into that unexplored territory centers on new experiments involving the mysterious subatomic particle known as the neutrino.</p>
<p>“It’s not to say that neutrinos are definitely the explanation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry, but a very large class of models that can explain this asymmetry are connected to neutrinos,” says <a href="https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/profile/turner/">Jessica Turner</a>, a theoretical physicist at Durham University in the United Kingdom.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/how-a-mysterious-particle-could-explain-the-universes-missing-antimatter/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">helped popularize the microSD Express standard</a> by requiring it for the new Switch 2 console. Created in 2019, the specification had languished in relative obscurity for years because the cheap, plentiful non-Express microSD cards were generally fast enough for the things that people were using them for, and because most hardware didn't support microSD Express cards in the first place.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo's console needed performance closer to that of an internal SSD to run games, given that the more powerful Switch 2 can run more of the titles being developed for SSD-equipped systems such as the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series S and X, and the PC. And now other companies are trying to push the "fast, removable storage" envelope even further.</p>
<p>The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/759624/china-is-about-to-launch-ssds-so-small-you-insert-them-like-a-sim-card">reports</a> that a Chinese company called Biwin has developed the "Mini SSD," a 15 by 17 mm-thick card that supports read speeds of up to 3,700MB per second due to a two-lane PCI Express 4.0 interface. The current microSD Express standard <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/press/thoughtleadership/sd-9-1-specification-introduces-new-speed-classes-and-next-level-performance-features-2/">can support roughly the same peak speeds</a> when connected to two PCIe 4.0 lanes. But in reality, most of today's cards top out around 900MB per second, roughly the amount of bandwidth available from a single PCI Express 3.0 lane.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/tiny-removable-mini-ssd-could-eventually-be-a-big-deal-for-gaming-handhelds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The recent rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-gpt-5-rollout-has-been-a-big-mess/">has not been going well</a>, to say the least. Users have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/chatgpt-users-outraged-as-gpt-5-replaces-the-models-they-love/">made vociferous complaints</a> about everything from the new model's more sterile tone to its supposed lack of creativity, increase in damaging confabulations, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mn8t5e/gpt5_is_a_mess/">and more</a>. The user revolt got so bad that OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/openai-brings-back-gpt-4o-after-user-revolt/">brought back the previous GPT-4o model as an option</a> in an attempt to calm things down.</p>
<p>To see just how much the new model changed things, we decided to put both GPT-5 and GPT-4o through our own gauntlet of test prompts. While we reused some of the standard prompts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">compare ChatGPT to Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">Deepseek</a>, for instance, we've also replaced some of the more outdated test prompts with new, more complex requests that reflect how modern users are likely to use LLMs.</p>
<p>These eight prompts are obviously far from a rigorous evaluation of everything LLMs can do, and judging the responses obviously involves some level of subjectivity. Still, we think this set of prompts and responses gives a fun overview of the kinds of differences in style and substance you might find if you decide to use OpenAI's older model instead of its newest.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/is-gpt-5-really-worse-than-gpt-4o-ars-puts-them-to-the-test/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration has ended potential enforcement actions against dozens of tech firms and 165 corporations overall, delivering on promises to end the alleged "weaponization" of the federal government, a <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/deleting-enforcement-trump-big-tech-billion-report/">report by nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen</a> said.</p>
<p>"In six months, the Trump administration has already withdrawn or halted enforcement actions against 165 corporations of all types—and one in four of the corporations benefiting from halted or dropped enforcement is from the technology sector, which has spent $1.2 billion on political influence during and since the 2024 elections," the report published on Wednesday said. The political spending includes $352 million that "is attributable to Elon Musk."</p>
<p>At the beginning of Trump's second term, there were at least 104 tech companies facing at least 142 federal investigations and enforcement actions, Public Citizen reported. The Trump administration has halted or withdrawn about one-third of the "targeted investigations into suspected misconduct and enforcement actions against technology corporations... So far, 47 enforcement actions (against 45 tech corporations) have been withdrawn or halted (38 withdrawn, nine halted)," the report said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/trump-admin-ranks-companies-on-loyalty-while-handing-out-favors-to-big-tech/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Zealous anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reviving a long-defunct federal vaccine panel that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/anti-vaccine-group-founded-by-rfk-jr-sues-rfk-jr-over-vaccine-task-force/">anti-vaccine advocates, including Kennedy, have long sought</a> and health experts fear will be used to dismantle evidence-based recommendations for life-saving childhood shots.</p>
<p>The panel is a task force outlined in the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/title-xxi-phs-vaccines-1517.pdf">National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986</a>, which is best known for setting up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The law states that the task force's goal is to "promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines on the market on the effective date of this part and promote the refinement of such vaccines."</p>
<p>The federal government has multiple overlapping procedures and systems that evaluate, review, and continuously monitor the safety of childhood vaccines, which have gone through rigorous testing and are well-established to be safe. Further, the government does, in effect, promote improved vaccines by providing grants to academic and industry researchers to develop advanced shots. It also conducts its own vaccine research toward that goal. For instance, researchers at the National Institutes of Health were critical in developing the mRNA vaccine technology that enabled the swift creation of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that saved millions of lives at the height of the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/anti-vaccine-rfk-jr-ominously-creates-panel-on-childhood-vaccines/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan weighed the option during a meeting on Monday at the White House, people familiar with the matter told WSJ. These talks have only just begun—with Intel branding them a rumor—and sources told the WSJ that Trump has yet to iron out how the potential arrangement might work.</p>
<p>The WSJ's report comes after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/president-trump-says-intels-new-ceo-must-resign-immediately/">Trump called for Tan to "resign immediately"</a> last week. Trump's demand was seemingly spurred by a <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-to-intel-ceos-ties-to-china-are-concerning">letter</a> that Republican senator Tom Cotton sent to Intel, accusing Tan of having "concerning" ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/us-may-purchase-stake-in-intel-after-trump-attacked-ceo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.06 of the Rocket Report! Two of the world's most storied rocket builders not named SpaceX achieved major successes this week. Arianespace's Ariane 6 rocket launched from French Guiana on its third flight Tuesday night with a European weather satellite. Less than 20 minutes later, United Launch Alliance's third Vulcan rocket lifted off from Florida on a US military mission. These are two of the three big rockets developed in the Western world that have made their orbital debuts in the last two years, alongside Blue Origin's New Glenn launcher. Ariane 6 narrowly won the "race" to reach its third orbital flight, but if you look at it another way, Ariane 6 reached its third flight milestone 13 months after its inaugural launch. It took Vulcan more than 19 months, and New Glenn has flown just once. SpaceX's Super Heavy/Starship rocket has flown nine times but has yet to reach orbit.</p>
