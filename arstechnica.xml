                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX fired six Raptor engines on the company's next Starship rocket Monday, clearing a major hurdle on the path to launch later this month on a high-stakes test flight to get the private rocket program back on track.</p>
<p>Starship ignited its Raptor engines Monday morning on a test stand near SpaceX's Starbase launch facility in South Texas. The engine ran for approximately 60 seconds, and SpaceX confirmed the test-firing in a <a href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1922361827712725019">post on X</a>: "Starship completed a long duration six-engine static fire and is undergoing final preparations for the ninth flight test."</p>
<p>SpaceX hasn't officially announced a target launch date, but maritime warnings along Starship's flight path over the Gulf of Mexico suggest the launch might happen as soon as next Wednesday, May 21. The launch window would open at 6:30 pm local time (7:30 pm EDT; 23:30 UTC). If everything goes according to plan, Starship is expected to soar into space and fly halfway around the world, targeting a reentry and controlled splashdown into the Indian Ocean.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-test-fires-starship-for-an-all-important-next-flight/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> is a host-your-own cloud platform that wants to help you "Regain control over your data." It contains products that allow for video chat, file storage, collaborative editing, and other stuff that reads a lot like a DIY Google Workspace replacement.</p>
<p>It's hard to offer that kind of full replacement, though, if your Android app can't upload anything other than media files. Since mid-2024, Nextcloud claims, Google has refused to reinstate the access it needs for uploading and syncing other file types.</p>
<p>"To make it crystal clear: All of you as users have a worse Nextcloud Files client because Google wanted that," reads <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-android-file-upload-issue-google/">a Nextcloud blog post</a> from May 13, attributed to its team. "We understand and share your frustration," but there is nothing we can do."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/nextcloud-accuses-google-of-big-tech-gatekeeping-over-android-app-permissions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft put a lot of focus on Windows 11's design when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/">released the operating system in 2021</a>, making a clean break with the design language of Windows 10 (which had, itself, simply tweaked and adapted Windows 8's design language from 2012). Since then, Microsoft has continued to modify the software's design in bits and pieces, both for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/the-latest-app-to-get-a-windows-11-redesign-the-humble-notepad/">individual apps</a> and for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-getting-better-for-people-who-open-tons-of-apps/">foundational UI elements</a> like the Taskbar, system tray, and Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Microsoft is currently testing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/back-to-basics-microsoft-tests-overhauled-start-menu-in-windows-11-beta-builds/">a redesigned version of the Windows 11 Start menu</a>, one that reuses most of the familiar elements from the current design but reorganizes them and gives users a few additional customization options. On its Microsoft Design blog today, the company <a href="https://microsoft.design/articles/start-fresh-redesigning-windows-start-menu/">walked through the new design</a> and showed some of the ideas that were tried and discarded in the process.</p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is adding a new security setting to Android to provide an extra layer of resistance against attacks that infect devices, tap calls traveling through insecure carrier networks, and deliver scams through messaging services.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the company <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/advanced-protection-mobile-devices.html">unveiled</a> the Advanced Protection mode, most of which will be rolled out in the upcoming release of Android 16. The setting comes as mercenary malware sold by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/jury-orders-nso-to-pay-167-million-for-hacking-whatsapp-users/">NSO Group</a> and a cottage industry of other exploit sellers continues to thrive. These players provide attacks-as-a-service through end-to-end platforms that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities on targeted devices, infect them with advanced spyware, and then capture contacts, message histories, locations, and other sensitive information. Over the past decade, phones running fully updated versions of Android and iOS have routinely been hacked through these services.</p>
<h2>A core suite of enhanced security features</h2>
<p>Advanced Protection is Google’s latest answer to this type of attack. By flipping a single button in device settings, users can enable a host of protections that can thwart some of the most common techniques used in sophisticated hacks. In some cases, the protections hamper performance and capabilities of the device, so Google is recommending the new mode mainly for journalists, elected officials, and other groups who are most often targeted or have the most to lose when infected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/google-introduces-advanced-protection-mode-for-its-most-at-risk-android-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The White House Office of Management and Budget dropped its "skinny" budget proposal for the federal government earlier this month, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/white-house-budget-seeks-to-end-sls-orion-and-lunar-gateway-programs/">the headline news</a> for the US space program was the cancellation of three major programs: the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Lunar Gateway.</p>
<p>Opinions across the space community vary widely about the utility of these programs—one friend in the industry predicted a future without them to be so dire that Artemis III would be the last US human spaceflight of our lifetimes. But there can be no question that if such changes are made they would mark the most radical remaking of NASA in two decades.</p>
<p>This report, based on interviews with multiple sources inside and out of the Trump administration, seeks to explain what the White House is trying to do with Moon and Mars exploration, what this means for NASA and US spaceflight, and whether it could succeed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/if-congress-actually-cancels-the-sls-rocket-what-happens-next/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While working on our review of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> last week, I was unable to test the game on the Steam Deck due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1kijszt/no_doom_the_dark_ages_does_not_run_on_steam_deck/">a bug that prevented it from launching</a> on SteamOS. I didn't consider this much of a loss at the time, since I figured the Deck's 3-year-old portable hardware was rated way below the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs">minimum PC specs for the game</a>, which call for ray tracing-capable graphics cards at a minimum.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529846144626329378">Valve released a preview build of a new version of SteamOS</a> that allows <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> to actually launch on the Steam Deck. And after a bit of testing, I found the game is surprisingly playable on Valve's portable hardware, provided you're prepared to turn down the graphics settings.</p>
<p>With all the graphical quality sliders set to "Low" (and FSR upscaling set to "Performance"), I was able to run <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> at the system's native 1280×800 resolution and a reasonably steady 30 to 40 fps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/doom-the-dark-ages-is-surprisingly-playable-on-the-steam-deck/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google accidentally showed off its big Android design refresh <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-accidentally-reveals-androids-material-3-expressive-interface-ahead-of-i-o/">last week</a>, but now Material 3 Expressive is official. Google says the new interface will begin with Android OS, but it will eventually expand across the full Google app ecosystem, bringing a more lively vibe to Gmail, Google Photos, and more.</p>
<p>Material 3 Expressive won't be entirely unfamiliar—it shares some basic design elements with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/android-12s-beautiful-color-changing-ui-already-lives-up-to-the-hype/">Material You system</a> Google launched four years ago. Material 3 Expressive is a bolder take on the same aesthetic, featuring "springy" animations, brighter colors, and new shapes.</p>

</div>
<p>As we learned from Google's slipup, Material 3 Expressive is the result of numerous user studies, which included more than 18,000 participants. Google explored how people parse information on their phone, finding design themes that supposedly support quicker and easier interactions. Often, that seems to result in making certain UI elements larger and easier to spot. Google claims people can find these important buttons four times faster than they can with older Material You interfaces.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-reveals-vibrant-material-3-expressive-coming-soon-to-a-pixel-near-you/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has threatened to revoke EchoStar licenses for radio frequency bands coveted by rival firms including SpaceX, which alleges that EchoStar is underutilizing the spectrum.</p>
<p>"I have directed agency staff to begin a review of EchoStar's compliance with its federal obligations to provide 5G service throughout the United States per the terms of its federal spectrum licenses," Carr wrote in a May 9 letter to EchoStar Chairman Charles Ergen. EchoStar and its affiliates "hold a large number of FCC spectrum licenses that cover a significant amount of spectrum," the letter said.</p>
<p>Ergen defended his company's wireless deployment but informed investors that EchoStar "cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome" of the FCC proceedings. The letter from Carr and Ergen's statement is included in a Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://ir.echostar.com/static-files/31f3efd9-c8a8-46c9-926e-634502de1e04">filing</a> submitted by EchoStar today. EchoStar's stock price was down about 8 percent in trading today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/fcc-threatens-echostar-licenses-for-spectrum-that-spacex-wants-to-use/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Windows 10 will stop getting free security updates on October 14, 2025.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>For most users, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/lots-of-pcs-are-poised-to-fall-off-the-windows-10-update-cliff-one-year-from-today/">Windows 10 will stop receiving security updates</a> and other official support from Microsoft on October 14, 2025, about five months from today. Until recently, Microsoft had also said that users running the Microsoft Office apps on Windows 10 would also lose support on that date, whether they were using the continually updated Microsoft 365 versions of those apps or the buy-once-own-forever versions included in Office 2021 or Office 2024.</p>
<p>Microsoft has recently tweaked this policy, however (as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665599/microsoft-365-office-apps-windows-10-end-of-support-extension-2028">seen by The Verge</a>). Now, Windows 10 users of the Microsoft 365 apps will still be <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-windows-end-of-support-means-for-office-and-microsoft-365-34e28be4-1e4f-4928-b210-3f45d8215595#ID0EBH=Microsoft_365&amp;id0ebh=microsoft_365">eligible to receive software updates and support through October of 2028</a>, "in the interest of maintaining your security while you upgrade to Windows 11." Microsoft is taking a similar approach to Windows Defender malware definitions, which will be offered to Windows 10 users "<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/10/31/how-to-prepare-for-windows-10-end-of-support-by-moving-to-windows-11-today/">through at least October 2028</a>."</p>
<p>The policy is a change from a few months ago, when Microsoft insisted that Office apps running on Windows 10 would become officially unsupported on October 14. The perpetually licensed versions of Office will be supported in accordance with Microsoft's "Fixed Lifecycle Policy," which guarantees support and security updates for a fixed number of years after a software product's initial release. For Office 2021, this means Windows 10 users will get support through October of 2026; for Office 2024, this should extend to October of 2029.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsoft-extends-office-support-on-windows-10-through-2028/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Samsung released its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/samsungs-galaxy-s25-event-was-an-ai-presentation-with-occasional-phone-hardware/">Galaxy S25 series</a> earlier this year to generally favorable reviews. It also teased the perplexingly thin S25 Edge, and now that phone is a reality. You can preorder Samsung's thinnest smartphone-ever today, but you should know what you're getting into. This $1,099 smartphone is incredibly slim, at just 5.8 mm, but it also steps down in the camera department and packs an anemic battery that may struggle to last all day.</p>
<p>This is a big, flat phone featuring a 120 Hz 6.7-inch OLED at 1440×3120. Like the S25 Ultra, it has a titanium frame with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The front has Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 for improved scratch protection. There's almost no bezel around the display—in fact, there's almost no phone around the display. The body is only 5.8 mm thick, a substantial reduction from the similarly sized S25+ at 7.3 mm. That's really this phone's claim to fame: It's really thin. Everything else (and we do mean everything) is secondary to that.</p>
<p>Cramming premium camera modules into a smartphone is an engineering challenge even when you're not trying to make the phone as slim as possible. Similar to foldables, there just isn't enough space in the S25 Edge for a full suite of Samsung cameras. Therefore, this phone only has two rear camera modules: a 200 MP primary shooter that appears identical to the S25 Ultra's and a meager 12 MP ultrawide. There's a 12 MP selfie camera on the front as well. There is no telephoto lens at all, which you get even on the base model S25.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/form-over-function-samsung-unveils-the-super-slim-galaxy-s25-edge/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Sunday night, House Republicans added language to the Budget Reconciliation bill that would block all state and local governments from regulating AI for 10 years, <a href="https://404media.co/republicans-try-to-cram-ban-on-ai-regulation-into-budget-reconciliation-bill/">404 Media</a> reports. The provision, introduced by Representative Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, <a href="https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/Subtitle_C_Communications_4e3fbcc3bc.pdf">states</a> that "no State or political subdivision thereof may enforce any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems during the 10 year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act."</p>
<p>The broad wording of the proposal would prevent states from enforcing both existing and proposed laws designed to protect citizens from AI systems. For example, California's <a href="https://www.mbc.ca.gov/Resources/Medical-Resources/GenAI-Notification.aspx">recent law</a> requiring health care providers to disclose when they use generative AI to communicate with patients would potentially become unenforceable. New York's 2021 law <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/about/automated-employment-decision-tools.page">mandating bias audits</a> for AI tools used in hiring decisions would also be affected, 404 Media notes. The measure would also halt legislation set to take effect in 2026 in California that requires AI developers to <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2013">publicly document</a> the data used to train their models.</p>
<p>The ban could also restrict how states allocate federal funding for AI programs. States currently control how they use federal dollars and can direct funding toward AI initiatives that may conflict with the administration's technology priorities. The Education Department's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-orders-doe-to-make-ai-a-national-priority-while-plotting-agencys-death/">AI programs</a> represent one example where states might pursue different approaches than those favored by the White House and its tech industry allies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">Read full article</a></p>

      One last trailer for <em>From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>We're about three weeks out from the theatrical release of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_World_of_John_Wick:_Ballerina">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</a>,</em> starring Ana de Armas. So naturally Lionsgate has released one final trailer to whet audience appetites for what promises to be a fiery, action-packed addition to the hugely successful franchise.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for 2019's <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>.)</strong></p>
<p>Chronologically, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/its-ana-de-armas-vs-john-wick-in-new-ballerina-trailer/"><em>Ballerina</em> takes place</a> during the events of <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/high-octane-ballerina-trailer-has-plenty-of-action-and-a-john-wick-cameo/">previously reported</a>, <em>Parabellum</em> found Wick declared excommunicado from the High Table for killing crime lord Santino D'Antonio on the grounds of the Continental. On the run with a bounty on his head, he makes his way to the headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston). The Director also trains young girls to be ballerina-assassins, and one young ballerina (played by Unity Phelan) is shown rehearsing in the scene. That dancer, Eve Macarro, is the main character in <em>Ballerina</em>, now played by de Armas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/ana-de-armas-is-caught-in-wicks-crosshairs-in-final-ballerina-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>WARREN, Mich.—If you've been following General Motors' development of electric vehicles on its Ultium platform, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it hasn't gone entirely smoothly. While plagued by some initial hiccups, GM has worked through those issues and now has a total of 12 EVs on the road. By my count, that's nine more than Ford, the crosstown rival that had a significant lead in this generation of EVs.</p>
<p>Furthering GM's advancement is the development of new battery technologies. Kurt Kelty, the company's newest head of batteries (after spending 12 years at Tesla), told me that new technology is a way to get to mass adoption of EVs.</p>
<p>"There needs to be price parity between gasoline and electric," he told me. "Without the tax credit."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/05/gms-new-ev-battery-will-offer-30-percent-more-range-for-less-money/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>These days, when Nicole Yelland receives a meeting request from someone she doesn’t already know, she conducts a multistep <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-startup-that-will-vet-you-for-your-next-job/">background check</a> before deciding whether to accept. Yelland, who works in public relations for a Detroit-based nonprofit, says she’ll run the person’s information through Spokeo, a personal data aggregator that she pays a monthly subscription fee to use. If the contact claims to speak Spanish, Yelland says, she will casually test their ability to understand and translate trickier phrases. If something doesn’t quite seem right, she’ll ask the person to join a Microsoft Teams call—with their camera on.</p>
<p>If Yelland sounds paranoid, that’s because she is. In January, before she started her current nonprofit role, Yelland says, she got roped into an elaborate scam targeting job seekers. “Now, I do the whole verification rigamarole any time someone reaches out to me,” she tells WIRED.</p>
<p>Digital imposter scams aren’t new; messaging <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/smishing-triad-scam-group/#intcid=_wired-article-bottom-recirc_8d8c8343-47e1-493e-b994-56eafa0d2e4c_roberta-similarity1">platforms</a>, social media sites, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-uncovered-an-army-of-fake-men-on-hinge/">dating apps</a> have long been rife with fakery. In a time when remote work and distributed teams have become commonplace, professional communications channels are no longer safe, either. The same artificial intelligence tools that tech companies promise will boost worker productivity are also making it easier for criminals and fraudsters to construct fake personas in seconds.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/welcome-to-the-age-of-paranoia-as-deepfakes-and-scams-abound/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Imagine a world where AI-powered bots can buy or sell cryptocurrency, make investments, and execute software-defined contracts at the blink of an eye, depending on minute-to-minute currency prices, breaking news, or other market-moving events. Then imagine an adversary causing the bot to redirect payments to an account they control by doing nothing more than entering a few sentences into the bot’s prompt.</p>
<p>That’s the scenario depicted in recently released research that developed a working exploit against ElizaOS, a fledgling open source framework.</p>
<p>ElizaOS is a framework for creating agents that use large language models to perform various blockchain-based transactions on behalf of a user based on a set of predefined rules. It was introduced in October under the name Ai16z and was changed to its current name in January. The framework remains largely experimental, but champions of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)—a model in which communities or companies are governed by decentralized computer programs running on blockchains—see it as a potential engine for jumpstarting the creation of agents that automatically navigate these so-called DAOs on behalf of end users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/ai-agents-that-autonomously-trade-cryptocurrency-arent-ready-for-prime-time/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The new Bentley Continental GT was already an imposing figure before this one left the factory in Crewe clad in dark satin paint and devoid of the usual chrome. And under the bonnet—or hood, if you prefer—you'll no longer find 12 cylinders. Instead, there's now an all-new twin-turbo V8 plug-in hybrid powertrain that offers both continent-crushing amounts of power and torque, but also a big enough battery for a day's driving around town.</p>
<p>We covered the details of the new hybrid a bit after our brief drive in the prototype <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/heres-what-we-learned-driving-a-prototype-of-bentleys-new-hybrid-gt/">this time last year</a>. At the time, we also shared that the new PHEV bits have been brought over from Porsche. There's quite a lot of Panamera DNA in the new Continental GT, as well as some recent Audi ancestry. Bentley is quite good at the engineering remix, though: Little more than a decade <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/all-stories-videos/hope-and-glory-the-wo-bentley-story/">after it was founded by W.O.</a>, the brand belonged to Rolls-Royce, and so started a long history of parts-sharing.</p>
<h2>Mind if I use that?</h2>
<p>Rolls-Royce and Bentley went their separate ways in 2003. The unraveling started a few years earlier when the aerospace company that owned them decided to rationalize and get itself out of the car business. In 1997, it sold the rights to Rolls-Royce to BMW, or at least the rights to the name and logos. Volkswagen Group got the rest, including the factory in Crewe, and got to work on a new generation of Bentleys for a new century.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-bentley-continental-gt-the-highs-and-lows-of-borrowed-bits/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Most robots rely on complex control systems, AI-powered or otherwise, that govern their movement. These centralized electronic brains need time to react to changes in their environment and produce movements that are often awkwardly, well, robotic.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. A team of Dutch scientists at the FOM Institute for Molecular and Atomic Physics (AMOLF) in Amsterdam built a new kind of robot that can run, go over obstacles, and even swim, all driven only by the flow of air. And it does all that with no brain at all.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/dutch-scientists-built-a-brainless-soft-robot-that-runs-on-air/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week's Tuesday Telescope photo is pretty meta as it features... a telescope.</p>
<p>This particular telescope is under construction in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, one of the darkest places on Earth with excellent atmospheric visibility. The so-called "Extremely Large Telescope" is being built on a mountaintop in the Andes at an elevation of about 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>And it really is extremely large. The primary mirror will be 39 meters (128 feet) in diameter. Like, that's gigantic for an optical telescope. It is nearly <em>four</em> times larger than the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_optical_reflecting_telescopes">operational reflecting telescopes in the world</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/tuesday-telescope-taking-a-look-at-the-next-generation-of-telescopes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission is proposing a DOGE-style overhaul of the agency's operations, including large cuts to the Universal Service Fund that subsidizes broadband deployment and access.</p>
<p>FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington said the fund should reduce spending on fiber networks and give money to Starlink—helping Elon Musk, the man in charge of President Trump's DOGE initiative. Simington also argued that the FCC is using too many staff hours on reviewing license applications and should instead use automated systems to approve most license requests.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/09/opinion-its-time-to-doge-the-fcc-nathan-simington-and-gavin-wax/">Daily Caller op-ed titled</a>, "It's Time For Trump To DOGE The FCC," Simington and his chief of staff, Gavin Wax, wrote that "President Trump's vision for restoring constitutional government is finally taking shape, and nowhere is that more urgently needed than at the Federal Communications Commission."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/fcc-republican-wants-to-doge-the-fcc-give-money-to-elon-musks-starlink/">Read full article</a></p>
