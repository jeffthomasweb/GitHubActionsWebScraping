                            <![CDATA[<p>Since I’m fascinated by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/samsungs-micro-rgb-tv-proves-the-value-of-rgb-backlights-for-premium-displays/">new</a> display <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/hdr10-advanced-joins-dolby-vision-2-in-trying-to-make-you-like-motion-smoothing/">technologies</a> and by improving image quality, I’ve never been a fan of home projectors. Projectors lack the image quality compared to good TVs and monitors, and they’re pretty needy. Without getting into the specific requirements of different models, you generally want a darker room with a large, blank wall for a projector to look its best. That can be a lot to ask for, especially in small, densely decorated homes like mine.</p>
<p>That said, a projector can be a space-efficient alternative to a big-screen TV or help you watch TV or movies outside. A projector can be versatile when paired with the right space, especially if that projector makes sure the “right space” is included in the device.</p>

Or, you can take off the fabric shroud and use the Splay as an ultra-short-throw projector and cast a display that measures up to 80 inches diagonally onto a wall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/the-splay-is-a-subpar-monitor-but-an-exciting-portable-projector/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tory Bruno, a veteran engineer and aerospace industry executive, has resigned from the top job at United Launch Alliance after more than a decade competing against the growing dominance of SpaceX, the company announced Monday.</p>
<p>The news of Bruno's sudden resignation was unexpected. His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA's market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/ulas-vulcan-rocket-shot-for-the-moon-on-debut-launch-and-hit-a-bullseye/">successful debut of ULA's Vulcan rocket</a>, followed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/ula-aimed-to-launch-up-to-10-vulcan-rockets-this-year-it-will-fly-just-once/">struggles to ramp up</a> the new rocket's launch cadence.</p>
<p>Bruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin's ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA's leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/in-a-surprise-announcement-tory-bruno-is-out-as-ceo-of-united-launch-alliance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the better part of two months last year, most of us had no idea how serious the problems were with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft docked at the International Space Station. A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA's workforce.</p>
<p>On its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing's Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.</p>
<p>The Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore <a href="http://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/the-harrowing-story-of-what-flying-starliner-was-like-when-its-thrusters-failed/">lost his ability to control</a> the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/safety-panel-says-nasa-should-have-taken-starliner-incident-more-seriously/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The world's largest shadow library—which is increasingly funded by AI developers—shocked the Internet this weekend by <a href="https://annas-archive.li/blog/backing-up-spotify.html">announcing</a> it had "backed up Spotify" and started distributing 300 terabytes of metadata and music files in bulk torrents.</p>
<p>According to Anna's Archive, the data grab represents more than 99 percent of listens on Spotify, making it "the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks." It's also "the world’s first 'preservation archive' for music which is fully open," with 86 million music files, the archive boasted.</p>
<p>The music files supposedly represent about 37 percent of songs available on Spotify as of July 2025. The scraped files were prioritized by popularity, with Anna's Archive weeding out many songs that are never streamed or are of poor quality, such as AI-generated songs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the US Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-protects-us-national-security-pausing-offshore-wind-leases">announced</a> that it was pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the US. The move comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. In what appears to be an attempt to avoid legal scrutiny, the Interior is blaming the decisions on a classified report from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The second Trump administration announced its animosity toward offshore wind power <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/">literally on day one</a>, issuing an executive order on inauguration day that called for a temporary halt to issuing permits for new projects pending a re-evaluation. Earlier this month, however, a judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trumps-order-blocking-wind-development-thrown-out-by-court/">vacated that executive order</a>, noting that the government has shown no indication that it was even attempting to start the re-evaluation it said was needed.</p>
<p>But a number of projects have gone through the entire permitting process, and construction has started. Before today, the administration had attempted to stop these in an erratic, halting manner. Empire Wind, an 800 MW farm being built off New York, was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/us-interior-secretary-orders-offshore-wind-project-shut-down/">stopped by the Department of the Interior</a>, which alleged that it had been rushed through permitting. That <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">hold was lifted</a> following lobbying and negotiations by New York and the project developer Orsted, and the Department of the Interior never revealed why it changed its mind. When the Interior Department blocked a second Orsted project, Revolution Wind offshore of southern New England, the company took the government to court and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">won a ruling</a> that let it continue construction.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/us-government-finds-new-excuse-to-stop-construction-of-offshore-wind/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Director Christopher Nolan won two well-deserved Oscars for 2023's <em>Oppenheimer</em>, and Hollywood was soon buzzing about what his next project might be. A vampire period piece, perhaps? Or maybe a reboot of 1983's <em>Blue Thunder</em> or British 1960s spy series <em>The Prisoner</em>? Instead, Nolan chose to adapt one of the greatest epic sagas in history: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">Homer's <em>Odyssey</em></a>. At long last, Universal has released the first official trailer for Nolan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey_(2026_film)"><em>The Odyssey</em></a>, starring Matt Damon as the wandering Ithacan king. Frankly, it looks appropriately epic.</p>
<p>Most of us read some version of <em>The Odyssey</em> in high school, so we're familiar with the story: Odysseus, legendary Greek king of Ithaca, begins the long journey home after 10 years of fighting in the Trojan War. (We actually catch a glimpse of the famous Trojan horse in the trailer.) But the journey does not go smoothly, as Odysseus and his men encounter the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, and an enchantress named Circe, among other obstacles. Meanwhile, his long-suffering wife Penelope is warding off hundreds of suitors eager to usurp Odysseus' position.</p>
<p>It's difficult to underestimate the tremendous influence Homer's epic has had on global culture. Nolan himself recalled seeing the <em>Odyssey</em> performed as a school play when he was just 5 or 6 years old. "I remember the Sirens and him being strapped to the mast and things like that," he recently told Empire. "I think it's in all of us, really. And when you start to break down the text and adapt it, you find that all of these other films—and all the films I've worked on—you know, they're all from the <i>Odyssey</i>. It's foundational."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/odyssey-trailer-brings-the-myth-to-vivid-life/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple was hit with a $115 million fine Monday after Italy's competition authority alleged the tech giant was abusing its dominant position to harm third-party developers in its App Store.</p>
<p>In a <a href="ttps://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2025/12/A561">press release</a>, the Italian Competition Authority said that an "App Tracking Transparency" (ATT) privacy policy that Apple introduced in 2021 forced third-party developers to seek consent twice for the same data collection.</p>
<p>Requiring such "double consent" was "extremely burdensome" and "harmful" to some developers—especially the smallest developers, the regulator <a href="https://en.agcm.it/dotcmsdoc/pressrelease/A561_SUMMARY.pdf">said</a>. Many developers struggled to earn ad revenue after the policy was introduced, as users increasingly declined to opt into personalized ads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/apple-hit-with-115m-for-extremely-burdensome-app-store-privacy-policy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>San Francisco was affected by <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/pg-e-outage-40-000-customers-without-power-21254326.php">a massive power outage</a> over the weekend. It started with a fire at a substation in the city on Saturday afternoon, causing a blackout that at times affected as much as a third of the city, leaving more than 130,000 homes without power. Among the city's affected critical systems were the traffic lights, which paralyzed Waymo's fleet of robotaxis, stopping them in their tracks and clogging traffic.</p>
<p>Any recent visitor to San Francisco can't help but notice the profusion of sensor-festooned autonomous vehicles on the roads, especially the all-white Jaguar I-Paces that belong to Waymo. The robotaxi company has more than 800 AVs in its Bay Area fleet; that can feel like a conservative estimate when you see five or six at a time—invariably with no occupants—within a block.</p>
<p>The cars navigate the city, combining high-resolution maps with inputs from lidar, optical, and other sensors on the upfitted Jags. The cars drive conservatively, but they can get confused in edge cases—earlier this month, Waymo <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/06/nx-s1-5635614/waymo-school-buses-recall">issued a recall</a> to fix a problem in which its robotaxis would illegally pass stopped school buses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/power-outage-paralyzes-waymo-robotaxis-when-traffic-lights-go-out/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Before he became chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr seemed to be a big believer in the agency's role as an independent branch of the federal government. According to the pre-2025 version of Brendan Carr, the White House interfered with the agency's independence when a Democratic president publicly urged the FCC to adopt net neutrality rules.</p>
<p>When the Biden-era FCC reinstated Obama-era net neutrality rules in 2024, <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-52A3.pdf">Carr alleged</a> that President Biden "took the extraordinary step to pressure the FCC—an independent agency that is designed to operate outside undue political influence from the Executive Branch." As evidence, Carr pointed to a <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">2021 executive order</a> in which Biden called on agency heads to "consider using their authorities" for various types of pro-competitive policies, including the adoption of net neutrality rules.</p>
<p>Carr said that President Obama similarly "pressure[d] an independent agency into grabbing power that the Legislative Branch never said it had delegated." Obama's intrusion into this independence, according to Carr, came in November 2014 when the president released a two-minute video <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/11/obama-urges-fcc-to-regulate-broadband-as-a-utility/">urging the agency</a> to implement net neutrality rules and reclassify broadband providers as common carriers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/no-one-loves-president-trump-more-than-fcc-chairman-brendan-carr/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p class="article-subhead">Caroline Muller looks at clouds differently than most people. Where others may see puffy marshmallows, wispy cotton candy or thunderous gray objects storming overhead, Muller sees fluids flowing through the sky. She visualizes how air rises and falls, warms and cools, and spirals and swirls to form clouds and create storms.</p>
<p>But the urgency with which Muller, a climate scientist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, considers such atmospheric puzzles has surged in recent years. As our planet swelters with global warming, storms are becoming more intense, sometimes dumping two or even three times more rain than expected. Such was the case in Bahía Blanca, Argentina, in March 2025: Almost half the city’s yearly average rainfall fell in less than 12 hours, causing deadly floods.</p>
<p>Atmospheric scientists have long used computer simulations to track how the dynamics of air and moisture might produce varieties of storms. But existing models hadn’t fully explained the emergence of these fiercer storms. A roughly 200-year-old theory describes how warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air: an extra 7 percent for every degree Celsius of warming. But in models and weather observations, climate scientists have seen rainfall events far exceeding this expected increase. And those storms can lead to severe flooding when heavy rain falls on already saturated soils or follows humid heatwaves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/when-clouds-flock-together/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>'Tis the season for all kinds of festive titles to start appearing in our to-watch queues. For folks who celebrate Christmas in any form, there are a million different movies and TV specials vying for your attention. There are the beloved favorites that we'll make the time to revisit year after year, plus the seemingly endless number of new titles arriving on the various streaming services this season.</p>
<p>But in all honesty, most of these movies are made for and by the mainstream. So if you don't want a broad family slapstick or yet another big city girl going back to her small town to learn the meaning of Christmas, here are a few options to bring some geekiness to your screen. Make the season nerdy and bright!</p>
<h2>Let's get it out of the way immediately: <em>Star Wars Holiday Special</em></h2>
<p>It's almost too bizarre to be believed, but yes, this was a thing that existed, and it lives on in legend. The cast of <em>Star Wars</em> returned for this TV special, where the gang goes to the Wookie planet Kashyyyk to celebrate Life Day. They're joined by some surprising guests. <em>Golden Girls</em> icon Bea Arthur is in it alongside The Honeymooners' Art Carney, acclaimed multi-disciplinary performer Diahann Carroll, and the band Jefferson Starship.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/12/discworld-daleks-and-deep-13-a-geeky-holiday-tv-and-movie-watchlist/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en">carbon border adjustment mechanism</a> (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.</p>
<p>If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/serpapi-lawsuit/">filed a lawsuit</a> to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google's 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google's terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google's decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.</p>
<p>SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world's largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google's SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can't summarize web links if it can't find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi's second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/reddit-sues-to-block-perplexity-from-scraping-google-search-results/?comments-page=1#comments">file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity</a> for grabbing its data from Google results.</p>
<p>Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it's not just doing this to protect itself—it's also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google's blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi "violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.</p>
<p>Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.</p>
<h2>The cost of armor</h2>
<p>In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/the-evolution-of-expendability-why-some-ants-traded-armor-for-numbers/">Read full article</a></p>

But they've remained <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">popular with publishers</a> that want to save production costs on a boxed Switch 2 game release, since Game Key Cards don't include any of the expensive flash memory found on a standard Switch 2 cartridge.</p>
<p>Now, though, at least one publisher has publicly suggested that Nintendo is offering cheaper Switch 2 cartridge options with smaller storage capacities, lowering production costs in a way that could make full cartridge releases more viable for many games on the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/regarding-the-physical-format-on-nintendo-switch-2-please-read-carefully">Earlier this week</a>, <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>publisher Inin Games explained to customers that it couldn't switch from Game Key Cards to a "full physical cartridge" for the retail version of the Switch 2 game without "significantly rais[ing] manufacturing costs." Those additional costs would "force us to increase the retail price by at least €15 [about $20]," Inin Games wrote at the time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/cheaper-lower-capacity-switch-2-cartridges-could-mean-fewer-game-key-cards/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Online fury erupted this week after an LG TV owner claimed that a firmware update installed unremovable generative AI software on their smart TV.</p>
<p>The controversy began on Saturday, when a Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1plldqo/my_lg_tvs_new_software_update_installed_microsoft/?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> about the sudden appearance of a Microsoft Copilot icon on their device (something Windows users are all too familiar with). The Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1plldqo/my_lg_tvs_new_software_update_installed_microsoft/?">claimed</a> that a “new software update installed Copilot” onto their LG TV and that it couldn’t be deleted.</p>
<p>“Pre-installed crap is universally dogshit. If I wanted it, I’d have installed it myself eventually. The whole reason it’s bundled is because no one would choose it… Burn your television,” another Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1plldqo/comment/ntt7z2y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">responded</a> in the thread, which has 36,000 upvotes as of this writing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/lg-tvs-unremovable-copilot-shortcut-is-the-least-of-smart-tvs-ai-problems/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At this point, most competitive online multiplayer games on the PC come with some kind of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/ring-0-of-fire-does-riot-games-new-anti-cheat-measure-go-too-far/">kernel-level anti-cheat software</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/eas-new-anti-cheat-tools-dip-into-the-dreaded-kernel-mode/">As we've written before</a>, this is software that runs with more elevated privileges than most other apps and games you run on your PC, allowing it to load in earlier and detect advanced methods of cheating. More recently, anti-cheat software has started to require more Windows security features like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/battlefield-6-dev-apologizes-for-requiring-secure-boot-to-power-anti-cheat-tools/">Secure Boot</a>, a TPM 2.0 module, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity?tabs=security">virtualization-based memory integrity protection</a>.</p>
<p>Riot Games, best known for titles like <em>Valorant</em> and <em>League of Legends </em>and the Vanguard anti-cheat software, has often been one of the earliest to implement new anti-cheat requirements. There's already <a href="https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/22291331362067-Vanguard-Restrictions">a long list of checks</a> that systems need to clear before they'll be allowed to play Riot's games online, and now the studio is announcing <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/vanguard-security-update-motherboard">a new one</a>: a BIOS update requirement that will be imposed on "certain players" following <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/382314">Riot's discovery of a UEFI bug</a> that could allow especially dedicated and motivated cheaters to circumvent certain memory protections.</p>
<p>In short, the bug affects the input-output memory management unit (IOMMU) "on some UEFI-based motherboards from multiple vendors." One feature of the IOMMU is to protect system memory from direct access during boot by external hardware devices, which otherwise might manipulate the contents of your PC's memory in ways that could enable cheating.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/some-valorant-players-need-to-update-their-pc-bios-to-keep-anti-cheat-software-happy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There’s a lot of goodwill out there for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/02/its-a-really-good-car-our-first-100-miles-in-a-2017-chevrolet-bolt/">the Chevrolet Bolt</a>. As maybe the first properly affordable longer-range electric car on the market, the Bolt wasn’t perfect. It didn’t charge very fast, and people found the seats quite uncomfortable. But it could get more than 230 miles on a single charge—a lot in 2017—and you didn’t have to be flush to afford one. Oh, and it was also pretty good to drive. I know I was a fan from the first time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/01/chevrolets-bolt-is-an-electric-vehicle-for-the-masses-and-weve-driven-it/">I tried a prototype</a> at CES in 2016.</p>
<p>Understandably, Bolt fans were upset when Chevy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/gm-confirms-chevy-bolt-will-die-this-year-making-way-for-electric-pickups/">decided to kill off the car</a>. Yes, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/04/the-2020-chevrolet-bolt-ev-is-solid-but-lacks-advanced-features/">it lacked features</a> compared to more modern EVs, but it is also the brand‘s bestselling EV by quite a country mile. "Not to worry," said the executives, who told us they had something better coming built on the platform they used to call Ultium but don’t anymore. Starting at around the same $35,000 price tag the Bolt launched with, this would be the new Equinox EV.</p>
<p>That $34,995 price tag was perhaps a bit more appealing when the car was eligible for the now-dead $7,500 IRS clean vehicle tax credit. Truth be told, the LT1 spec is a little bare-boned, and you'll need to step up to the LT2 we tested—which starts at $40,295—if you want things like heated seats or wireless charging for your devices. (The good news here is that people looking for a bargain should know that used Equinox EVs with decent specs are already much cheaper, just a year after the car's launch.) And let's not forget, when the Bolt was young, the more expensive trim was almost $42,000.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/the-chevrolet-equinox-ev-is-high-on-comfort-and-convenience/">Read full article</a></p>
