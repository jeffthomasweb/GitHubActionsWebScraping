<p>As a summer wave of COVID-19 infections swells once again, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403211">a study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine</a> offers some positive news about the pandemic disease: Rates of long COVID have declined since the beginning of the health crisis, with rates falling from a high of 10.4 percent before vaccines were available to a low of 3.5 percent for those vaccinated during the omicron era, according to the new analysis.</p>
<p>The study, led by Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research at the VA Saint Louis Health Care System, used data from a wealth of health records in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The researchers ultimately included data from over 440,000 veterans who contracted COVID-19 sometime between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2022, as well as over 4.7 million uninfected veterans who acted as controls.</p>
<p>Al-Aly and colleagues divided the population into eight groups. People who were infected during the study period were divided into five groupings by the dates of their first infection and their vaccination status. The first group inlcuded those infected in the pre-delta era before vaccines were available (March 1, 2020, to June 18, 2021). Then there were vaccinated and unvaccinated groups who were infected in the delta era (June 19, 2021, to December 18, 2021) and the omicron era (December 19, 2021, and January 31, 2022). The uninfected controls made up the final three of eight groups, with the controls assigned to one of the three eras.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038076#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038076&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, Apple announced a slate of more than a dozen upcoming Immersive Videos for its Vision Pro spatial reality headset. The first, titled <em>Boundless</em>, launches tonight at 9 pm ET. More will follow in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/apple-debuts-first-new-3d-video-content-for-vision-pro-in-two-months/">long, slow period</a> for new Vision Pro-specific video content from Apple. The headset launched in early February with a handful of Immersive Video episodes ranging from five to 15 minutes each. Since then, only three new videos have been added.</p>
<p>On March 28, Apple released a highlight reel of Major League Soccer plays from the season that had ended months prior. A second episode of <em>Prehistoric Planet</em>, Apple's Immersive Video dinosaur nature documentary, went live on April 19. Likewise, a new episode of the <em>Adventure</em> series titled "Parkour" landed on May 24.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037983#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037983&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Netflix today confirmed suspicions that it will stop letting people pay $12 per month to stream without commercials.</p>
<p>The ad-free Basic plan was the cheapest way to watch Netflix without commercials. The plan limits users to 720p resolution and one device and lets people download content. Netflix stopped offering the Basic plan to new subscribers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/netflix-hungry-for-more-growth-signals-more-price-hikes/">in January.</a> In June, Netflix started <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/all-the-ways-streaming-services-are-aggravating-their-subscribers-this-week/">booting subscribers</a> in the UK and Canada off the plan and automatically put them onto a cheaper subscription plan with ads.</p>
<p>In a letter to shareholders today [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FINAL-Q2-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">PDF</a>], Netflix confirmed publicly for the first time that it “will now start” to phase out the ad-free Basic plan in the US and France. This will make the cheapest commercial-free Netflix plan $15.49/month in the US. That Standard plan supports up to two devices, downloads, and 1080p resolution.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038032#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038032&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HbWFaJgXe3I?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">The HBO Original Series <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> will premiere this November. </p></div>
<p>Fans of director Denis Villeneuve's epic two-part film adaptation of Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> have no doubt been curious about the upcoming HBO Max series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_Prophecy"><em>Dune: Prophecy</em></a>. It's a prequel series inspired by the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisterhood_of_Dune"><em>Sisterhood of Dune</em></a>, written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, exploring the origins of the <a title="Bene Gesserit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit">Bene Gesserit.</a> The studio just dropped a tantalizing teaser rife with political intrigue, ominous warnings, and a bit of hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>The series was first announced in 2019, with Villeneuve serving as an executive producer and Alison Schapker (<em>Alias, Fringe, Altered Carbon</em>) serving as showrunner. The first season will consist of six episodes, and it's unclear how closely the series will adhere to the source material. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Set 10,000 years before the ascension of Paul Atreides, <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> follows two Harkonnen sisters as they combat forces that threaten the future of humankind, and establish the fabled sect that will become known as the Bene Gesserit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emily Watson co-stars as Valya Harkonnen, leader of the Sisterhood, with Olivia Williams playing her sister, Tula Harkonnen. Mark Strong plays Emperor Javicco Corrino, described as "a man from a great line of war-time Emperors, who is called upon to govern the Imperium and manage a fragile peace," while Jodhi May plays Empress Natalya and Sarah-Sofie Boussnina plays Princess Ynez.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037901#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037901&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The face huggers and chest bursters return with a vengeance in a few weeks when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Romulus"><em>Alien: Romulus</em></a> finally hits theaters. It's the latest installment in the Alien franchise from horror director Fede Alvarez (<em>Don't Breathe</em>,<em> Evil Dead</em>), and the final action-packed trailer just dropped.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/03/teaser-for-alien-romulus-hints-that-franchise-is-returning-to-its-horror-roots/">previously reported</a>, <em>Alien: Romulus</em> is set between the events of <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> (and is not related to FX/Hulu's <em>Alien</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(American_TV_series)">prequel series</a> slated to premiere next year). That is, after Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of the <em>Nostromo</em>, destroyed the killer xenomorph and launched herself into space in the ship's lifeboat—along with the ginger cat, Jonesy—and before she woke up after 57 years in hypersleep and battled more xenomorphs while protecting the young orphan, Newt (Carrie Henn). Per the short-and-sweet official premise: "While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037950#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037950&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's fight defending X's content moderation decisions isn't just with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/elon-musks-x-scrambles-to-keep-court-case-against-media-matters-in-texas/">hate speech researchers</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/elon-musk-calls-for-criminal-prosecution-of-x-ad-boycott-perpetrators/">advertisers</a>. He has also long been battling regulators, and this week, he seemed positioned to secure a potentially big win in California, where he's hoping to permanently block a law that he claims unconstitutionally forces his platform to justify its judgment calls.</p>
<p>At a hearing Wednesday, three judges in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals seemed inclined to agree with Musk that a California law requiring disclosures from social media companies that clearly explain their content moderation choices likely violates the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Passed in 2022, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB587">AB-587</a> forces platforms like X to submit a "terms of service report" detailing how they moderate several categories of controversial content. Those categories include hate speech or racism, extremism or radicalization, disinformation or misinformation, harassment, and foreign political interference, which X's lawyer, Joel Kurtzberg, told judges yesterday "are the most controversial categories of so-called awful but lawful speech."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037997#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037997&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission today <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-caps-exorbitant-phone-video-call-rates-incarcerated-persons">voted</a> to lower price caps on prison phone calls and closed a loophole that allowed prison telecoms to charge high rates for intrastate calls. Today's vote will cut the price of interstate calls in half and set price caps on intrastate calls for the first time.</p>
<p>The FCC said it "voted to end exorbitant phone and video call rates that have burdened incarcerated people and their families for decades. Under the new rules, the cost of a 15-minute phone call will drop to $0.90 from as much as $11.35 in large jails and, in small jails, to $1.35 from $12.10."</p>
<p>The new rules are expected to take effect in January 2025 for all prisons and for jails with at least 1,000 incarcerated people. The rate caps would take effect in smaller jails in April 2025.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037977#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037977&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple TV+ has carved a niche for itself with strong original programming, and while it's still far behind the likes of Netflix in terms of subscribers, it has seen a fairly strong initial run. To build on that, Apple is talking with major studios about ways to complement its slate of original programming with films from other companies in order to expand and extend the service's appeal.</p>
<p>That's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/apple-is-in-talks-to-license-more-films-from-hollywood?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">according</a> to Bloomberg reporters Lucas Shaw and Thomas Buckley, who cite people familiar with Apple's workings. Those sources say Apple is "having discussions" with more than one large film studio about bringing more movies to the service.</p>
<p>Apple previously experimented with this by licensing around 50 movies and making them available on the service for limited runs over the past several months. That experiment seems to have gone well, leading Apple to begin laying the groundwork for expanding on that.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037940#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037940&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After every one of its house-brand phones, and even its new wall charger, have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/all-four-of-googles-pixel-9-phones-get-lined-up-and-shot-by-regulators/">meticulously photographed</a>, sized, and rated for battery capacity, what should Google do to keep the anticipation up for the Pixel 9 series' August 13 debut?</p>
<p>Lean into it, it seems, and Google is doing so with an eye toward further promoting its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/google-launches-gemini-a-powerful-ai-model-it-says-can-surpass-gpt-4/">Gemini-based AI</a> aims. In <a href="https://x.com/madebygoogle/status/1813967957590241437">a video post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Google describes a "phone built for the Gemini era," one that can, through the power of Gemini, "even let your old phone down easy" with a breakup letter. The camera pans out, and the shape of the Pixel 9 Pro appears and turns around to show off the now-standard Pixel camera bar across the upper back.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A phone built for the Gemini era. <br>It can do a lot—even let your old phone down easy. <br><br>Learn more and sign up for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MadeByGoogle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MadeByGoogle</a> updates: <a href="https://t.co/PUmAUi4YBe">https://t.co/PUmAUi4YBe</a> <a href="https://t.co/I3EEXOkq3I">pic.twitter.com/I3EEXOkq3I</a></p>— Made by Google (@madebygoogle) <a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1813967957590241437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>NASA has spent $450 million designing and building a first-of-its-kind robot to drive into eternally dark craters at the Moon's south pole, but the agency announced Wednesday it will cancel the rover due to delays and cost overruns.</p>
<p>"NASA intends to discontinue the VIPER mission," said Nicky Fox, head of the agency's science mission directorate. "Decisions like this are never easy, and we haven’t made this one, in any way, lightly. In this case, the projected remaining expenses for VIPER would have resulted in either having to cancel or disrupt many other missions in our Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) line."</p>
<p>NASA has terminated science missions after development delays and cost overruns before, but it's rare to cancel a mission with a spacecraft that is already built.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037786#p3">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037786&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You have to read the headline on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-transitions-fully-towards-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/">Nvidia's latest GPU announcement</a> slowly, parsing each clause as it arrives.</p>
<p>"Nvidia transitions fully" sounds like real commitment, a burn-the-boats call. "Towards open-source GPU," yes, evoking <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/nvidia-takes-first-step-toward-open-source-linux-gpu-drivers/">the company's "first step" announcement a little over two years ago</a>, so this must be progress, right? But, back up a word here, then finish: "GPU kernel modules."</p>
<p>So, Nvidia has "achieved equivalent or better application performance with our open-source GPU kernel modules," and added some new capabilities to them. And now most of Nvidia's modern GPUs will default to using open source GPU kernel modules, starting with driver release R560, with dual GPL and MIT licensing. But Nvidia has moved most of its proprietary functions into a proprietary, closed-source firmware blob. The parts of Nvidia's GPUs that interact with the broader Linux system are open, but the user-space drivers and firmware are none of your or the OSS community's business.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037900#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037900&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

(credit: Jonathan Gitlin)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Fairly or not, the Mazda CX-90 PHEV had a lot to make up for. The last electrified Mazda we drove was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/making-sense-of-mazdas-mx-30-electric-commuter-car/">the abysmal MX-30</a>, a cynical compliance car that proved <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/07/29/mazda-kills-off-mx-30-ev-in-us-again-after-selling-just-66-cars/">too unpopular to remain on sale</a>. That was a small hatchback crossover with suicide doors and a cork interior. The CX-90 PHEV, Mazda's full-size SUV, is a much more substantial proposition, with seating for up to eight and starting at a reasonable $47,445.</p>
<p>You may miss out on some of the very newest bells and whistles found in the latest German or Korean luxury cars, but as electrified three-rows go, there's a fair bit to like about this one.</p>
<h2>Tech specs</h2>
<p>The CX-90 uses a newly developed Mazda platform for larger vehicles, with rear-biased all-wheel drive powertrains. There's a turbocharged mild hybrid inline-six cylinder engine available in two different levels of tune, but the one we're interested in is the e-Skyactiv G powertrain, which pairs a turbocharged four-cylinder engine generating 189 hp (141 kW) and 192 lb-ft (260 Nm) with a 173 hp (129 kW), 199 lb-ft (270 Nm) permanent magnet synchronous electric motor.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037845#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037845&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            Nintendo's Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) seems useful, but it's coming out at a strange time in the console's lifecycle.                           [credit:

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>Nintendo's Switch launched in March 2017, and all available information indicates that the company is on track to announce a successor early next year. It's that timing that makes the launch of Nintendo's latest Switch accessory so odd: The company has announced a first-party charging cradle for Joy-Con controllers, which up until now have been charged by slotting them into the console itself, via Nintendo's sold-separately <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N33MFPK/?tag=arstech20-20">Joy-Con charging grip</a>, or with third-party charging accessories.</p>
<p>The Nintendo of Europe account on X, formerly Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1813846178439557413">announced</a> that the charging accessory—formally called the "Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way)"—will be released on October 17. It will work with both Joy-Cons and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers/">Switch Online wireless NES controllers</a>, and the charging cradle can be separated from its stand (where it looks a lot like the Joy-Con charging grip but without the grip part).</p>
<p>Power is provided via a USB-C port on top of the stand, which can either be connected to one of the Switch dock's USB ports or to a separate USB-C charger. Other Switch controllers, including the Pro Controller and the SNES and N64 replica controllers, are charged via USB-C directly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037837#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037837&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Full suspension mountain bikes are complicated beasts, with sections of the frame that pivot and a shock absorber to moderate that pivot. These parts help limit the bumps that reach your body and keep your rear tire in contact with the trail across all sorts of terrain and obstacles. The complexity and additional parts, however, boost the costs of full suspension bikes considerably, a situation that only gets worse when you electrify things.</p>
<p>As a result, some of the electric mountain bikes we've looked at are either <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/i-am-superman-the-trek-exe-mountain-e-bike-reviewed/">very expensive</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/mountains-on-a-budget-swft-expands-its-e-bike-offerings/3/">make a few too many compromises</a> to bring the price down. Even aiming for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/into-the-rivers-and-through-the-woods-specializeds-e-mountain-bike/">middle-of-the-road compromise</a> hardware costs in the area of $5,000.</p>
<p>But there's one easy way to lower the price considerably: lose the full suspension. The electric "hardtails" from major manufacturers typically cost considerably less than a full suspension bike with similar components. And because the engineering demands are considerably lower than in a full suspension bike, it's easier for some of the smaller e-bike companies to put together a solid offering.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037242#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037242&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, OpenAI announced the launch of <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/">GPT-4o mini</a>, a new, smaller version of its latest <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a> AI language model that will replace <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/chatgpt-and-whisper-apis-debut-allowing-devs-to-integrate-them-into-apps/">GPT-3.5 Turbo</a> in ChatGPT, reports <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/18/openai-4o-mini-model-announced.html">CNBC</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/openai-releases-gpt-4o-mini-a-cheaper-version-of-flagship-ai-model">Bloomberg</a>. It will be available today for free users and those with ChatGPT Plus or Team subscriptions and will come to ChatGPT Enterprise next week.</p>

<p>GPT-4o mini will reportedly be multimodal like its big brother (which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">launched in May</a>), with image inputs currently enabled in the API. OpenAI says that in the future, GPT-4o mini will be able to interpret images, text, and audio, and also will be able to generate images.</p>
<p>GPT-4o mini supports 128K tokens of input context and a knowledge cutoff of October 2023. It's also very inexpensive as an API product, costing 60 percent less than GPT-3.5 Turbo at 15 cents per million input tokens and 60 cents per million output tokens. Tokens are fragments of data that AI language models use to process information.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037843#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037843&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>RealPage says it isn’t doing anything wrong by suggesting to landlords how much rent they could charge. In a move to reclaim its own narrative, the property management software company published a microsite and a digital booklet it’s calling “<a href="https://www.realpagepublicpolicy.com/">The Real Story</a>,” as it faces multiple lawsuits and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/20/rental-housing-market-doj-investigation-00147333">reported federal criminal probe</a> related to allegations of rental price fixing.</p>
<p>RealPage’s <a href="https://www.realpagepublicpolicy.com/realpagestatement">six-page digital booklet</a>, published on the site in mid-June, addresses what it calls “false and misleading claims about its software”—the myriad of allegations it faces involving price-fixing and rising rents—and contends that the software benefits renters and landlords and increases competition. It also said landlords accept RealPage’s price recommendations for new leases less than 50 percent of the time and that the software recommends competitive prices to help fill units.</p>

<p>Too many EV startups do a great job on the electric side but not so great on the car side of the equation—and sometimes they don't do either particularly well. But the Air Pure wasn't just good; it was excellent. It's the rare car I had trouble finding flaws with, even after it locked me out in a parking lot.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Archaeologists have hotly debated the precise cause of death of those who perished in Pompeii when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. Did they die of asphyxiation, from the extreme heat, or from a combination of factors? A <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1386960/full">new pape</a>r published in the journal Frontiers in Earth Science examines the complicating effects of earthquakes that occurred just prior to and concurrently with the eruption. Of most interest was the discovery of two skeletons of people who likely died when their shelter collapsed around them, weakened by the seismic tremors.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/archaeologists-find-evidence-of-neurons-in-glassy-brain-of-vesuvius-victim/">previously reported</a>, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius released thermal energy roughly equivalent to 100,000 times the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, spewing molten rock, pumice, and hot ash over the cities of Pompeii and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum">Herculaneum</a> in particular. Archaeologists believed that the vast majority of the victims died of asphyxiation, choking to death on the thick clouds of noxious gas and ash.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35071167" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/35071167" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1721250225262cha" data-uri="44b7efba43618e280ac86fdfda3170fd" data-xid="fr1721250225262cha">a 2001 study</a> in Nature, co-authored by University of Naples archaeologist Pierpaolo Petrone, estimated a temperature of 500° Celsius (932° Fahrenheit) for the pyroclastic surge that destroyed Pompeii, sufficient to kill inhabitants in fractions of a second. In 2018, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/extreme-heat-of-vesuvius-eruption-vaporized-body-fluids-exploded-skulls/" data-uri="b3ce29bec641296785b5db5697e27271">we reported</a> on Petrone's conclusion that inhabitants of Herculaneum may have suffered a similar fate. He observed fracturing in the bones of some 100 excavated skeletons, as well as "cracking and explosion" of the skullcaps, consistent with forensic cases where skulls burst from extreme heat.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037477#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037477&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since the acquisition closed in 2021, the Google-fication of Fitbit has largely meant a reduction in features and a focus from Google on getting people onto the Fitbit app. Long-time users have flocked to Fitbit—sometimes upon Fitbit's request—to share hundreds of complaints about recent changes. However, Google has been mostly unresponsive to customer feedback.</p>
<h2>Web app discontinuation angers users</h2>
<p>In June, Google announced it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/googles-abuse-of-fitbit-continues-with-web-app-shutdown/">discontinuing Fitbit.com's online dashboard</a>. After July 8, users seeking similar features that the web app provided must download the Fitbit mobile app. On Fitbit’s Community forum, a company representative <a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-com-Dashboard/Fitbit-com-web-dashboard-is-transitioning-to-the-Fitbit-app/td-p/5613159">confirmed</a> that users’ “details and logging for activities, nutrition, sleep, and weight” would remain available via the app. However, the change inconvenienced users who preferred or needed to access such data on a bigger screen than that on a phone. Worse, the app lacks some of the features of the online dashboard, such as food logging.</p>
<p>Despite these obvious user drawbacks, the need to Googlize Fitbit seemed to drive the change. Announcing the news on the Community forum, a Fitbit company rep said:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037668#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037668&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've ever seen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/how-to-play-and-broadcast-video-games-non-stop-for-a-week-straight/">a record-breaking video game speedrun</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/how-to-play-and-broadcast-video-games-non-stop-for-a-week-straight/">watched a Games Done Quick marathon</a>, you may have entertained fantasies that you, too, could put up some decent times on your favorite old games. Sure, it would probably take a bit of practice, but what these speedrunners are doing doesn't look <em>that difficult</em>, does it? How hard can it be to press a few buttons with good timing for a few minutes?</p>
<p>After spending a few weeks with <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>, I no longer think that way. The game's bite-size chunks of classic Nintendo games highlight the level of precision needed for even a few minutes of speedrunning perfection, not to mention the tedium of practicing the same in-game motions dozens of times to build up the needed muscle memory. In the process, I gained a newfound respect for the skill displayed by the best speedrunners and found a fresh way to experience some classic NES games that I felt I knew backward and forward.</p>
<h2>Gotta go fast</h2>
<p>While <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> draws its name from a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/after-100000-bid-3-more-ultra-rare-nintendo-world-championship-carts-appear/">series</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/nintendo-brings-back-its-world-championships-competition-25-years-later/">competitions</a> dating back to 1990, it draws its inspiration much more directly from the more recent rise of <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/">the online speedrunning community</a>. Thus, the game's main single-player mode is named "Speedrun," tasking players with putting up the fastest times in 150 mini-challenges spread across 13 different Nintendo-developed NES titles.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037726#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037726&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
