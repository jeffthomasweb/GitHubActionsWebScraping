                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The Event Horizon Telescope only recently gave us <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/event-horizon-telescope-gives-us-first-images-of-what-its-named-for/">the first images</a> of the environment immediately surrounding a black hole. Since then, it has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/event-horizon-telescope-captures-stunning-new-image-of-milky-ways-black-hole/">boosting the resolution</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/event-horizon-telescope-captures-birth-of-black-hole-jet-in-centaurus-a/">filling in the details</a> of an environment dominated by the most extreme gravity in the Universe.</p>
<p>But which gravity are we talking about? Because of its incompatibility with quantum mechanics and our current inability to explain dark matter, people have proposed all sorts of variants of gravity that go beyond general relativity and clean up some of the physics’ awkwardness. It’s possible that the extreme environment near a black hole amplifies the differences among at least some of these hypotheses. So, a group of physicists decided to see whether any of those differences might be large enough that the next generation of telescopes might be able to rule out some potential replacements for relativity.</p>
<h2>Searching for subtlety</h2>
<p>Any replacement for general relativity faces an awkward challenge: General relativity does pretty well at explaining everything from the large-scale structure of the Universe to phenomena we can measure right here on Earth. So, any alternative theories would have to differ from relativity in very subtle ways that might be extremely difficult to detect.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/imaging-black-holes-may-help-us-rule-out-some-models-of-gravity/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the world’s most ruthless and advanced hacking groups, the Russian state-controlled Sandworm, launched a series of destructive cyberattacks in the country’s ongoing war against neighboring Ukraine, researchers reported Thursday.</p>
<p>In April, the group targeted a Ukrainian university with two wipers, a form of malware that aims to permanently destroy sensitive data and often the infrastructure storing it. One wiper, tracked under the name Sting, targeted fleets of Windows computers by scheduling a task named DavaniGulyashaSdeshka, a phrase derived from Russian slang that loosely translates to “eat some goulash,” researchers from ESET <a href="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/en/papers/threat-reports/eset-apt-activity-report-q2-2025-q3-2025.pdf">said</a>. The other wiper is tracked as Zerlot.</p>
<h2>A not-so-common target</h2>
<p>Then, in June and September, Sandworm unleashed multiple wiper variants against a host of Ukrainian critical infrastructure targets, including organizations active in government, energy, and logistics. The targets have long been in the crosshairs of Russian hackers. There was, however, a fourth, less common target—organizations in Ukraine’s grain industry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/wipers-from-russias-most-cut-throat-hackers-rain-destruction-on-ukraine/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla shareholders today voted to approve a compensation plan that would pay Elon Musk more than $1 trillion over the next decade if he hits all of the plan’s goals. Musk won over 75 percent of the vote, according to the announcement at today’s shareholder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGPlvmMjPtE">meeting</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465925087598/tm252289-4_pre14a.htm">pay plan</a> would give Musk 423,743,904 shares, awarded in 12 tranches of 35,311,992 shares each if Tesla achieves various operational goals and market value milestones. Goals include delivering 20 million vehicles, obtaining 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, delivering 1 million “AI robots,” putting 1 million robotaxis in operation, and achieving a $400 billion adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).</p>
<p>Musk has threatened to leave if he doesn’t get a larger share of Tesla. He <a href="https://youtu.be/GQ9S7xbkGAY?t=2057">told investors</a> last month, “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money. It’s just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army? Not control, but a strong influence. That’s what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/elon-musk-wins-tesla-pay-vote-that-could-make-him-a-1-trillion-man/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has announced new features in the popular Google Finance platform, and it leans heavily on Google’s tried-and-true strategy of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/at-i-o-2025-google-leaves-no-doubt-that-ai-mode-is-the-future-of-search/">more AI in more places</a>. This builds on Google’s last Finance update, which added a Gemini-based chatbot. Now, Google is adding Gemini Deep Research to the site, which will allow users to ask much more complex questions. You can also ask questions about the future, backed by new betting market data sources.</p>
<p>The update, which is rolling out over the next several weeks, will add a Deep Research option to the Finance chatbot. The company claims that with the more powerful AI, users will be able to generate “fully cited” research reports on a given topic in just a few minutes. So you can expect an experience similar to Deep Research in the Gemini app—you give it a prompt, and then you come back later to see the result.</p>
<p>You probably won’t want to bother with Deep Research on simple queries—there are faster, easier ways to get that done. Google suggests using Deep Research on more complex things, like the doozy below.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/gemini-deep-research-comes-to-google-finance-backed-by-prediction-market-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T has been told to stop running ads that falsely promise all customers a free iPhone. The rebuke came from the advertising industry’s official watchdog just a week after AT&amp;T sued the organization over a different advertising dispute.</p>
<p>BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Review Board (NARB) “has recommended that AT&amp;T Services, Inc. modify its advertising to avoid conveying a false message regarding eligibility for an iPhone device offer,” the group, which runs the ad industry’s self-regulatory system, <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media/newsroom/decisions/appeal-att-iphone">said today</a>.</p>
<p>Verizon initiated the case by challenging AT&amp;T’s “Learn how everyone gets iPhone 16 Pro on us” claim. BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD) ruled in favor of Verizon in September 2025. AT&amp;T <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media/newsroom/decisions/att-free-iphone">appealed</a> but lost the challenge in the NARB decision announced today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/att-falsely-promised-everyone-a-free-iphone-ad-industry-board-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/meta-is-earning-fortune-deluge-fraudulent-ads-documents-show-2025-11-06/">report</a>, Reuters exposed five years of Meta practices and failures that allowed scammers to take advantage of users of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Documents showed that internally, Meta was hesitant to abruptly remove accounts, even those considered some of the “scammiest scammers,” out of concern that a drop in revenue could diminish resources needed for artificial intelligence growth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/bombshell-report-exposes-how-meta-relied-on-scam-ad-profits-to-fund-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>American inspections of foreign food facilities—which produce everything from crawfish to cookies for the US market—have plummeted to historic lows this year, a ProPublica analysis of federal data shows, even as inspections reveal alarming conditions at some manufacturers.</p>
<p>About two dozen current and former Food and Drug Administration officials blame the pullback on deep staffing cuts under the Trump administration. The stark reduction marks a dramatic shift in oversight at a time when the United States has never been more dependent on foreign food, which accounts for the vast majority of the nation’s seafood and more than half its fresh fruit.</p>
<p>The stakes are high: Foreign products have been <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5382743/">increasingly linked</a> to outbreaks of foodborne illness. In recent years, FDA investigators have uncovered disturbing lapses in facilities producing food bound for American supermarkets. In Indonesia, cookie factory workers hauled dough in soiled buckets. In China, seafood processors slid crawfish along cracked, stained conveyor belts. Investigators have reported crawling insects, dripping pipes, and fake testing data purporting to show food products were pathogen free.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-people-die-trump-cuts-hit-food-inspections/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of Russia’s most important projects over the last 15 years has been the construction of the Vostochny spaceport as the country seeks to fly its rockets from native soil and modernize its launch operations.</p>
<p>However, the initiative has been a fiasco from the start. After construction began in 2011, the project was beset by hunger strikes, claims of unpaid workers, and the theft of $126 million. Additionally, a man driving a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/04/even-an-embezzled-diamond-encrusted-mercedes-cant-stop-russian-launch/">diamond-encrusted Mercedes</a> was arrested after embezzling $75,000. Five years ago, there was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/russian-spaceport-officials-are-being-sacked-left-and-right/">another purge of top officials</a> after another round of corruption.</p>
<p>Through it all, there has been some progress. In 2016, a Soyuz-2 rocket launched from the first pad, “1S.” And eight years later, a second pad, “1A,” opened with a successful Angara rocket launch. Eventually, the Russian space corporation, Roscosmos, would like to operate seven launch pads at the Vostochny in the far eastern area of Russia, so development work continues.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/after-russian-spaceport-firm-fails-to-pay-bills-electric-company-turns-the-lights-off/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Star Trek fans who have long envied the Star Wars franchise’s collaboration with Lego are finally getting something to celebrate: Lego is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2025/november/lego-icons-star-trek-u-s-s-enterprise-ncc-1701-d-">introducing a version</a> of Star Trek’s <em>USS Enterprise</em>, specifically the <em>Enterprise-D</em> from <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>.</p>
<p>Because we don’t live in the post-money utopian society of the 24th century, the kit will cost you, and unfortunately, it’s priced well into the for-superfans-only zone. The 3,600-piece starship and collection of minifigs <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/star-trek-u-s-s-enterprise-ncc-1701-d-10356">will run you $400</a> when the set officially leaves spacedock on November 28.</p>
<p>Though the <em>Enterprise-D</em> is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/from-the-original-series-to-picard-weve-ranked-every-starship-enterprise/">far from our favorite <em>Enterprise</em></a>, it does make sense as a starting point for the Lego Group. <em>The Next Generation</em>‘s seven-year run in the late ’80s and early ’90s represents a creative and cultural peak for the franchise, and a 2010s-era remaster that painstakingly re-scanned and upgraded all of the original footage and effects for high-definition TVs has kept the old episodes looking fresher than other ’90s Trek shows like <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and <em>Voyager.</em></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/11/lego-boldly-goes-into-the-star-trek-universe-with-400-3600-piece-enterprise-d/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-planning-powerful-ai-data-centre-tiny-australian-indian-ocean-outpost-2025-11-06/">reported</a> that Google is planning to build a large AI data center on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island">Christmas Island</a>, a 52-square-mile Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, following a cloud computing deal with Australia’s military. The previously undisclosed project will reportedly position advanced AI infrastructure a mere 220 miles south of Indonesia at a location military strategists consider critical for monitoring Chinese naval activity.</p>
<p>Aside from its strategic military position, the island is famous for its massive <a href="https://christmasislandnationalpark.gov.au/discover/highlights/red-crab-migration/">annual crab migration</a>, where over 100 million of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island_red_crab">red crabs</a> make their way across the island to spawn in the ocean. That’s notable because the tech giant has applied for environmental approvals to build a subsea cable connecting the 135-square-kilometer island to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory">Darwin</a>, where US Marines are stationed for six months each year.</p>
<p>The project follows a three-year cloud agreement Google signed with Australia’s military in July 2025, but many details about the new facility’s size, cost, and specific capabilities remain “secret,” according to Reuters. Both Google and Australia’s Department of Defense declined to comment when contacted by the news agency.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/google-plans-secret-ai-military-outpost-on-tiny-island-overrun-by-crabs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The University of Pennsylvania has a somewhat unusual distinction: It is the <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/11/penn-trump-elon-musk-administration-government-efficiency"><em>alma mater</em> of two of the planet’s most polarizing figures</a>, Elon Musk and Donald Trump. As the political power of both men rose over the last year, the US government began to pressure Penn, first by pulling its research funding and then by targeting the school for past actions related to a transgender swimmer.</p>
<p>After the “sticks” were deployed, a “carrot” was offered. Penn became one of just nine schools nationally to be offered a special “compact” with the federal government, which would give the feds broad control over the school and its speech in return for preferential access to federal funds. Penn <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/with-deadline-looming-4-of-9-universities-reject-trumps-compact-to-remake-higher-ed/">declined to sign the deal</a>. (Making the whole surreal situation stranger was the fact that one of Penn’s own wealthy boosters apparently <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/10/penn-marc-rowan-questions-trustees-compact">helped the Trump administration write the compact</a>.)</p>
<p>In other words, Penn has become an obvious target of the Trump administration; now it has been targeted by a hacker claiming to share Trump and Musk’s grievances over affirmative action and “wokeness.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/musk-and-trump-both-went-to-penn-now-hacked-by-someone-sympathetic-to-their-cause/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Doctors in Belgium met with a real head-scratcher when an 83-year-old married man came in with a rare form of secondary syphilis—the second of four stages of the sexually transmitted bacterial infection that has been called a “master of disguise.”</p>
<p>The man told doctors up front that he was in a monogamous 50-year-long marriage and had been sexually inactive in recent years following treatment for cancer. In <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcps2507868">a Clinical Problem-Solving report</a> published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors laid out the step-by-step tests and reasoning they used to get to the right diagnosis, which still didn’t answer all their questions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/rare-form-of-syphilis-in-married-elderly-man-nearly-stumps-doctors/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google on Wednesday revealed five recent malware samples that were built using generative AI. The end results of each one were far below par with professional malware development, a finding that shows that vibe coding of malicious wares lags behind more traditional forms of development and, thus, still has a long way to go before it poses a real-world threat.</p>
<p>One of the samples, for instance, tracked under the name PromptLock, was part of an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20444v1">academic study</a> analyzing how effective the use of large language models can be “to autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle.” The researchers, however, reported the malware had “clear limitations: it omits persistence, lateral movement, and advanced evasion tactics” and served as little more than a demonstration of the feasibility of AI for such purposes. Prior to the paper’s release, security firm ESET said it had discovered the sample and <a href="https://www.eset.com/us/about/newsroom/research/eset-discovers-promptlock-the-first-ai-powered-ransomware/">hailed</a> it as “the first AI-powered ransomware.”</p>
<h2>Don’t believe the hype</h2>
<p>Like the other four samples Google analyzed—FruitShell, PromptFlux, PromptSteal, and QuietVault—PromptLock was easy to detect, even by less-sophisticated endpoint protections that rely on static signatures. All samples also employed previously seen methods in malware samples, making them easy to counteract. They also had no operational impact, meaning they didn’t require defenders to adopt new defenses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/ai-generated-malware-poses-little-real-world-threat-contrary-to-hype/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>If adopted, the rule change would allow DHS agencies, including <span id="_XLwLaa67Jr_O0PEPrYuW8Q0_46" class="wtBS9">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</span> (ICE), to broadly collect facial imagery, finger and palm prints, iris scans, and voice prints. They may also request DNA, which DHS claimed “would only be collected in limited circumstances,” like to verify family relations. These updates would cost taxpayers $288.7 million annually, DHS estimated, including $57.1 million for DNA collection alone. Annual individual charges to immigrants submitting data will likely be similarly high, estimated at around $231.5 million.</p>
<p>Costs could be higher, DHS admitted, especially if DNA testing is conducted more widely than projected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/dhs-wants-to-use-biometrics-to-track-immigrant-kids-throughout-their-lives/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Quantum computers based on ions or atoms have one major advantage: The qubits themselves aren’t manufactured, and there’s no device-to-device among atoms. Every atom is the same and should perform similarly every time. And since the qubits themselves can be moved around, it’s theoretically possible to entangle any atom or ion with any other in the system, allowing for a lot of flexibility in how algorithms and error correction are performed.</p>
<p>This combination of consistent, high-fidelity performance with all-to-all connectivity has led many key <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/microsoft-performs-operations-with-multiple-error-corrected-qubits/">demonstrations of quantum computing</a> to be done on trapped-ion hardware. Unfortunately, the hardware has been held back a bit by relatively low qubit counts—a few dozen compared to the hundred or more seen in other technologies. But on Wednesday, a company called Quantinuum announced a new version of its trapped-ion hardware that significantly boosts the qubit count and uses some interesting technology to manage their operation.</p>
<h2>Trapped-ion computing</h2>
<p>Both neutral atom and trapped-ion computers store their qubits in the spin of the nucleus. That spin is somewhat shielded from the environment by the cloud of electrons around the nucleus, giving these qubits a relatively long coherence time. While neutral atoms are held in place by a network of lasers, trapped ions are manipulated via electromagnetic control based on the ion’s charge. This means that key components of the hardware can be built using standard electronic manufacturing, although lasers are still needed for manipulations and readout.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/new-quantum-computing-hardware-sorts-ions-for-computation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google and Disney have been in a contract dispute since October 30 that has resulted in YouTube TV subscribers losing access to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/16654675?visit_id=638968431803573294-3963843398&amp;p=disney&amp;rd=1">21 Disney-owned TV channels</a>, including ABC, ESPN, and The Disney Channel.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing access to popular live content, the corporate conflict is highlighting another frustration in the streaming era. As Google and Disney continue duking it out, their customers have lost some access to content they thought was permanent: DVR files and digital movie purchases.</p>
<p>A perk of subscribing to YouTube TV, per <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/">Google’s marketing</a>, is the ability to “record it all with unlimited DVR space.” A footnote on the YouTube TV homepage notes that unlimited DVR is subject to “device, regional, and Internet restrictions” but overlooks an additional restriction in the form of multi-conglomerate spats.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/youtube-tvs-disney-blackout-reminds-users-that-they-dont-own-what-they-stream/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Flock Safety—the surveillance company behind the country’s largest network of automated license plate readers (ALPRs)—currently faces attacks on multiple fronts seeking to tear down the invasive and error-prone cameras across the US.</p>
<p>This week, two lawmakers, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-krishnamoorthi-urge-ftc-to-investigate-surveillance-tech-company-on-negligently-handling-americans-personal-data">called</a> for a federal investigation, alleging that Flock has been “negligently handling Americans’ personal data” by failing to use cybersecurity best practices. The month prior, Wyden wrote a <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_flock.pdf">letter</a> to Flock CEO Garrett Langley, alleging that Flock’s security failures mean that “abuse of Flock cameras is inevitable” and that they threaten to expose billions of people’s harvested data should a catastrophic breach occur.</p>
<p>“In my view, local elected officials can best protect their constituents from the inevitable abuses of Flock cameras by removing Flock from their communities,” Wyden wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/flock-haters-cross-political-divides-to-remove-error-prone-cameras/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Google announced Tuesday a new initiative, named Project Suncatcher, to examine the feasibility of bringing artificial intelligence to space. The idea is to deploy swarms of satellites in low-Earth orbit, each carrying Google’s AI accelerator chips designed for training, content generation, synthetic speech and vision, and predictive modeling. Google calls these chips Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.</p>
<p>“Project Suncatcher is a moonshot exploring a new frontier: equipping solar-powered satellite constellations with TPUs and free-space optical links to one day scale machine learning compute in space,” Google <a href="https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/">wrote in a blog post.</a></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/if-you-want-to-satiate-ais-hunger-for-power-google-suggests-going-to-space/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has spent the last few years waging a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">losing battle against Epic Games</a>, which accused the Android maker of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/epic-gives-fortnite-players-discounts-for-skirting-apple-google-fees/">illegally stifling competition in mobile apps</a>. Losses in court left Google to make sweeping changes to the Play Store, but Google appeared poised to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court. That is unlikely now that Epic and Google have reached a settlement in the case. It still needs to be approved by the judge, but the agreement provides a framework for long-term changes to Android app distribution that would apply globally.</p>
<p>Late last month, Google was forced to make the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-begins-loosening-developer-restrictions-in-play-store-against-its-will/">first round of mandated changes</a> to the Play Store to comply with the court’s ruling. It grudgingly began allowing developers to direct users to alternative payment options and app downloads outside of Google’s ecosystem. By next summer, Google was supposed to open up Android to third-party app stores in a big way.</p>
<p>These changes were only mandated for three years and in the United States. The new agreement includes a different vision for third-party stores on Android—one that Google finds more palatable and that still gives Epic what it wants. If approved, the settlement will lower Google’s standard fee for developers. There will also be new support in Android for third-party app stores that will reduce the friction of leaving the Google bubble. Under the terms of the settlement, Google will support these changes through at least June 2032.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/google-settlement-with-epic-caps-play-store-fees-boosts-other-android-app-stores/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Windows 11 25H2 update is relatively minor compared to last year’s 24H2 update (the “25” here is a reference to the year the update was released, while the “H2” denotes that it was released in the second half of the year, a vestigial suffix from when Microsoft would release two major Windows updates per year). The 24H2 update came with some major under-the-hood overhauls of core Windows components and significant performance improvements for the Arm version; 25H2 is largely 24H2, but with a rolled-over version number to keep it in line with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-11-home-and-pro">Microsoft’s timeline for security updates and tech support</a>.</p>
<p>But Microsoft’s continuous update cadence for Windows 11 means that even the 24H2 version as it currently exists isn’t the same one Microsoft released a year ago.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">Read full article</a></p>
