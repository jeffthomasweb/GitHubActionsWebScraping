              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.34 of the Rocket Report! What a day in space Thursday was. During the morning hours we saw the triumphant second flight of the Ariane 6 rocket, a pivotal moment for European sovereignty in space. Then Intuitive Machines had a partially successful landing on the Moon. And finally, on Thursday evening, SpaceX's Starship failed during its second consecutive test flight.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For a long time, the cheapest iPhones were basically just iPhones that were older than the current flagship, but last week’s release of the $600 iPhone 16e marks a big change in how Apple is approaching its lineup.</p>
<p>Rather than a repackaging of an old iPhone, the 16e is the latest main iPhone—that is, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/iphone-16-and-16-pro-review-camera-features-headline-a-mature-product/">iPhone 16</a>—with a bunch of stuff stripped away.</p>
<p>There are several potential advantages to this change. In theory, it allows Apple to support its lower-end offerings for longer with software updates, and it gives entry-level buyers access to more current technologies and features. It also simplifies the marketplace of accessories and the like.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/iphone-16e-review-the-most-expensive-cheap-iphone-yet/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Inside a small control room, during the middle of the day on Thursday local time in Texas, about a dozen white-knuckled engineers at a space startup named Intuitive Machines started to get worried. Their spacecraft, a lander named Athena, was beginning its final descent down to the lunar surface.</p>
<p>A little more than a year had passed since the company's first attempt to land on the Moon with a similarly built vehicle, Odysseus. Due to problems with that spacecraft's laser rangefinder, it skidded into the Moon's surface and toppled over.</p>
<p>So engineers at Intuitive Machines had checked, and re-checked the laser-based altimeters on Athena. When the lander got down within about 30 km of the lunar surface, they tested the rangefinders again. Worryingly, there was some noise in the readings as the laser bounced off the Moon. However, the engineers had reason to believe that, maybe, the readings would improve as the spacecraft got nearer to the surface.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/intuitive-machines-second-attempt-to-land-on-the-moon-also-went-sideways/">Read full article</a></p>

But we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/indie-devs-outraged-by-unlicensed-game-sales-on-gamestops-nft-market/">rarely</a> seen a case of alleged game theft as blatant as the one surrounding recent iOS App Store hit <em>My Baby or Not!</em>, which appears to cross the line from mere cloning into outright code theft of recent indie web game <em>Diapers, Please!</em>.</p>
<p>The small, five-person development team at <a href="https://voltekplay.itch.io/">VoltekPlay</a> created <em>Diapers, Please!</em> as part of <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-13">a recent one-week Game Jam</a>. The game was <a href="https://voltekplay.itch.io/diapers-please">posted as a free-to-play HTML5 release on itch.io</a> on February 23, featuring simple gameplay that involves choosing a baby that matches the visual traits of two pictured parents (with a little bit of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/papers-please-review-paper-trail-of-tears/"><em>Papers, Please</em>-style</a> authoritarian styling to boot).</p>
<p>Three days later, on February 26, <em>My Baby or Not!</em> appeared on the App Store, with screenshots and gameplay that looked not just similar but downright <em>identical</em> to the <em>Diapers, Please!</em> web release. The two games even shared the same description:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/more-than-a-clone-this-viral-ios-game-allegedly-committed-wholesale-code-theft/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A pair of Carnegie Mellon University researchers <a href="https://iliao2345.github.io/blog_posts/arc_agi_without_pretraining/arc_agi_without_pretraining.html">recently discovered</a> hints that the process of compressing information can solve complex reasoning tasks without pre-training on a large number of examples. Their system tackles some types of abstract pattern-matching tasks using only the puzzles themselves, challenging conventional wisdom about how machine learning systems acquire problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>"Can lossless information compression by itself produce intelligent behavior?" ask <a href="https://iliao2345.github.io/">Isaac Liao</a>, a first-year PhD student, and his advisor Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DVCHv1kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Albert Gu</a> from CMU's Machine Learning Department. Their work suggests the answer might be yes. To demonstrate, they created <a href="https://github.com/iliao2345/CompressARC">CompressARC</a> and published the results in a <a href="https://iliao2345.github.io/blog_posts/arc_agi_without_pretraining/arc_agi_without_pretraining.html">comprehensive post</a> on Liao's website.</p>
<p>The pair tested their approach on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (<a href="https://arcprize.org/arc">ARC-AGI</a>), an unbeaten visual benchmark created in 2019 by machine learning researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Chollet">François Chollet</a> to test AI systems' abstract reasoning skills. ARC presents systems with grid-based image puzzles where each provides several examples demonstrating an underlying rule, and the system must infer that rule to apply it to a new example.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/compression-conjures-apparent-intelligence-in-new-puzzle-solving-ai-approach/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The 184-foot-tall (56-meter) rocket lifted off from Kourou, French Guiana, at 11:24 am EST (16:24 UTC). Twin solid-fueled boosters and a hydrogen-fueled core stage engine powered the Ariane 6 through thick clouds on an arcing trajectory north from the spaceport on South America's northeastern coast.</p>
<p>The rocket shed its strap-on boosters a little more than two minutes into the flight, then jettisoned its core stage nearly eight minutes after liftoff. The spent rocket parts fell into the Atlantic Ocean. The upper stage's Vinci engine ignited two times to reach a nearly circular polar orbit about 500 miles (800 kilometers) above the Earth. A little more than an hour after launch, the Ariane 6 upper stage deployed CSO-3, a sharp-eyed French military spy satellite, to begin a mission providing optical surveillance imagery to French intelligence agencies and military forces.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/when-europe-needed-it-most-the-ariane-6-rocket-finally-delivered/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Most Android phones ship with Google's Gboard as the default input option. It's a reliable, feature-rich on-screen keyboard, so most folks just keep using it instead of installing a third-party option. Depending on how you feel about circles, it might be time to check out some of those alternatives. Google has quietly released an update that changes the shape and position of the keys, and users <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1j4zz2l/no_one_asked_for_this_google/">are not pleased</a>.</p>
<p>In the latest build of Gboard (v15.1.05.726012951-beta-arm64-v8a), Google has changed the key shape from the long-running squares to circle shapes. If you're using the four-row layout, the keys are like little pills. In five-row mode with the exposed number row, the keys are collapsed further into circles. The reactions seem split between those <a href="https://x.com/troubleflame/status/1897592384008954198">annoyed by this change</a> and those annoyed that everyone else is so annoyed.</p>
<p>Change can be hard sometimes, so certainly some of the discontent is just a function of having the phone interface changed without warning. If you find it particularly distasteful, you can head into the Gboard settings and open the Themes menu. From there, you can tap on a theme and then turn off the key borders. Thus, you won't be distracted by the horror of rounded edges. That's not the only problem with the silent update, though.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/no-one-asked-for-this-google-is-testing-round-keys-in-gboard/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration is eliminating a preference for fiber Internet in a $42.45 billion broadband deployment program, a change that is expected to reduce spending on the most advanced wired networks while directing more money to Elon Musk's Starlink and other non-fiber Internet service providers. One report suggests Starlink could obtain $10 billion to $20 billion under the new rules.</p>
<p>Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick criticized the Biden administration's handling of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program in a <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/03/statement-us-secretary-commerce-howard-lutnick-bead-program">statement</a> yesterday. Lutnick said that "because of the prior Administration's woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies, and burdensome regulations, the program has not connected a single person to the Internet and is in dire need of a readjustment."</p>
<p>The BEAD program was authorized by Congress in November 2021, and the US was finalizing plans to distribute funding before Trump's inauguration. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), part of the Commerce Department, developed rules for the program in the Biden era and <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/blog/2024/every-state-and-territory-ready-implement-internet-all">approved</a> initial funding plans submitted by every state and territory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In an early clinical trial, an experimental norovirus vaccine given as a pill produced defensive responses exactly where it counts—in the saliva of older people most vulnerable to the explosive stomach bug.</p>
<p>The results, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ads0556">published this week in Science Translational Medicine</a>, are another step in the long effort to thwart the gruesome germ, which finds a way to violently hollow out innards wherever people go—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/chipotle-faces-federal-criminal-probe-for-one-of-its-several-outbreaks/">from restaurants</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/the-grand-canyon-is-brimming-with-norovirus-sickening-over-150/">natural wonders</a> and even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/cruise-industry-salty-over-cdc-plan-to-keep-travelers-safe-from-covid-at-sea/">the high seas</a>. It's a robust, extremely infectious virus that spreads via the nauseating fecal-oral route. Infected people spew billions of virus particles in their vomit and diarrhea, and shedding can last weeks. The particles aren't easily killed by hand sanitizers and can linger on surfaces for up to two weeks. Exposure to as few as 10 virus particles can spark an infection. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,</a> norovirus causes an average of between 19 and 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis in the US every year, leading to 109,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths. This racks up an economic burden estimated to be $2 billion to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32671397/">$10.6 billion</a>.</p>
<h2>Vaccine design</h2>
<p>For most, the gut-busting bug is miserable but usually over in a few days. But older people—especially those with underlying medical conditions—are vulnerable to severe outcomes. About 90 percent of people who die from a norovirus infection are people age 65 or older who live in long-term care facilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/saliva-that-fights-norovirus-experimental-oral-vaccine-is-nothing-to-spit-at/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Creating new and exciting tech products requires thinking outside of the box. At this week's Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference in Barcelona, we got a peek at some of the research and development happening in the hopes of forging a functional gadget that people might actually want to buy one day.</p>
<p>While MWC is best known for its smartphone developments, we thought we'd break down the most intriguing, non-phone prototypes brought to the show for you. Since these are just concept devices, it's possible that you'll never see any of the following designs in real products. However, every technology described below is being demonstrated via a tangible proof of concept. And the companies involved—Samsung and Lenovo—both have histories of getting prototyped technologies into real gadgets.</p>

<p>How many times must something repeat before it's considered a trend? We ask because Samsung Display this week demoed the <em>third</em> recent take we've seen on integrating computing devices into suitcases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/the-most-intriguing-tech-gadget-prototypes-demoed-this-week/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>1Password has announced a new feature that lets you <a href="https://blog.1password.com/add-locations-to-items/">assign a geolocation to items stored in your vault</a>. At first glance, that might not seem like much: a new little box inside a mobile utility you use on occasion. But allow me to remind you of something many of us cannot get away from: Terrible yet semi-mandatory apps with awful names that sign you out just when you need them.</p>
<p>The Ticketmaster app, for example, will always be signed out right when you're coming up to the front of the line at the venue and the line suddenly starts moving faster. Or you will remember you have a discount or coupon inside a store or takeout joint's app, but you will remember this only after every item has been scanned, just as the eyes of those in line behind you start burning holes into your neck. The airline on which you are flying ensures you are not logged in right before you arrive at the airport, so you can spend a little more time at their self-service kiosk, holding your bags so they don't tip over while you log back in.</p>
<p>Can you get by without using these apps? Technically, yes. But they're quite handy in a pinch, and 1Password's newest feature actually does something to make them even more accessible.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/1password-offers-geo-locating-help-for-bad-apps-that-constantly-log-you-out/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania boasts sediment layers dating back to about 1.8 million years ago. Those layers contain simple stone tools that marked one of the earliest recorded technological transitions. Now, researchers have uncovered a substantial cache of prehistoric bone tools in the same region dating back 1.5 million years. It's the oldest collection of mass-produced bone tools yet known, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08652-5">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature. And while it's still unclear which hominin species crafted the tools, the discovery suggests that our early human ancestors had some advanced reasoning skills a good million years earlier than previously thought.</p>
<p>“The tools show evidence that their creators carefully worked the bones, chipping off flakes to create useful shapes," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1075635?">said co-author Renata F. Peters</a>, an archaeologist at University College London. "We were excited to find these bone tools from such an early timeframe. It means that human ancestors were capable of transferring skills from stone to bone, a level of complex cognition that we haven’t seen elsewhere for another million years.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/early-hominins-were-surprisingly-good-engineers/">previously reported</a>, species on the hominin family tree have made and used stone tools for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/03/new-study-tracks-the-evolution-of-stone-tools/">about 2.6 million years</a>. For instance, <em>Homo habilis </em>was an early member of our genus who walked upright and had a mixture of human and ape-like features. Starting around 1.2 million years ago, a later hominin species called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/12/ancient-doodle-hints-that-homo-erectus-was-smarter-than-we-thought/"><em>Homo erectus</em></a> made more complex stone tools, like hand axes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/prehistoric-bone-tool-cache-suggests-advanced-reasoning-in-early-hominins/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Senate voted to block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from monitoring digital payments companies for fraud and privacy concerns—which Democratic lawmakers Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/as-elon-musk-tries-to-destroy-the-cfpb-warren-schiff-demand-answers-from-office-of-government-ethics-on-conflicts-of-interest">said</a> gave Elon Musk a "get out of jail free card."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The vote advanced a proposed <a href="https://www.ricketts.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SIL25249.pdf">joint resolution</a> to the House of Representatives that "disapproves" of a final rule Republicans <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finalizes-rule-on-federal-oversight-of-popular-digital-payment-apps-to-protect-personal-data-reduce-fraud-and-stop-illegal-debanking/">introduced</a> last year that was supposed to bring consumer protection regulation of digital payments companies in line with traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, lawmakers were concerned about tech companies spying on consumers' transactions, preventing valid transaction disputes over incorrect or fraudulent money transfers, and other potential harms to consumers "when they lose access to their app without notice or when their ability to make or receive payments is disrupted."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-killing-cfpb-slammed-as-get-out-of-jail-free-card-for-elon-musks-x-money/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's a reason that the suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona, were home to many autonomous vehicle programs: Driving on wide streets in great weather is easy mode for an AV. But a commercial robotaxi service that only works when the sun is shining is a commercial robotaxi service that will never recoup the billions it would cost to develop. That's why Moia—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/ridesharing-and-cleaner-quieter-transport-volkswagens-answer-is-called-moia/">Volkswagen's AV division</a>—has begun testing its autonomous ID Buzzes around the streets of Oslo, Norway, this winter.</p>
<p>For a while, autonomous driving was the hottest thing in tech. That hype has certainly calmed down a lot over the last few years as reality began to bite. Developing an AV that can safely drive around unpredictable humans turned out to be pretty hard, with myriad edge cases needing to be solved differently for each new city.</p>
<p>Startups have shut down, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/self-driving-startups-are-becoming-an-endangered-species/">winnowing the field</a>. Uber gave its AV program to Aurora, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/uber-sells-self-driving-project-to-startup-aurora/">together with a rather fat investment check</a>; Aurora these days is concentrating on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/volvo-debuts-its-fully-autonomous-big-rig-truck-powered-by-auroras-tech/">autonomous trucking</a> rather than robotaxis on busy city streets. VW, together with Ford, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/argo-ai-will-cease-operations-as-ford-and-volkswagen-pull-investments/">gave up on Argo AI</a>. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/seeing-no-road-to-profit-gm-shutters-cruise/">General Motors killed off Cruise AV</a>, seeing no way to make back the large pile of money it had already spent trying to make robotaxis work in San Francisco.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/vw-is-testing-its-robotaxis-in-snowy-icy-norway/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="bolded">ow D lived</span> on a dairy farm in New Zealand. The animal looked like the typical black-and-white cow farmers raise for milk, except for one thing: Researchers had outfitted Cow D with an artificial fistula—a hole offering them a way to reach the microbes inhabiting the animal’s bathtub-size stomach. But it’s what happened next that offers a porthole into the global debate over the use of genetic data.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2009, Samantha Noel, then a doctoral researcher at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand, reached into Cow D’s rumen and plucked out a strain of Lachnospiraceae bacterium, later dubbed ND2006. Another team of geneticists sequenced the microbe’s complete set of genes, or genome, and uploaded the information, which was then shared with GenBank, a public database run by the US National Institutes of Health. If genes are the book of life, then this process was like adding a digital copy to an online library. In policy circles, these lines of code go by another name: digital sequence information, or DSI.</p>
<p>Eventually, a section of the sequence found inside Cow D caught the attention of scientists on the other side of the world. The sequence contained a promising new genetic tool for modifying DNA, a CRISPR. Editas Medicine, a Massachusetts-based company focused on commercializing gene-editing technology for medical applications, used these data to build its platform and now holds the license on a portfolio of patents—all without ever interacting with the cow or its microbes directly. The company subsequently developed an experimental therapy, which involved injecting a modified CRISPR-associated molecule into patients’ eyeballs to treat a common form of inherited blindness. Editas billed the breakthrough as the first such treatment “administered to people anywhere in the world.” The results, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309915">published</a> in the New England Journal of Medicine, contain little mention of any sequence data and even less about its origins.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/who-gets-ownership-of-useful-genetic-data/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A newly discovered network botnet comprising an estimated 30,000 webcams and video recorders—with the largest concentration in the US—has been delivering what is likely to be the biggest denial-of-service attack ever seen, a security researcher inside Nokia said.</p>
<p>The botnet, tracked under the name Eleven11bot, first came to light in late February when researchers inside Nokia’s Deepfield Emergency Response Team <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeromemeyer_new-ddos-botnet-discovered-over-30000-hacked-activity-7301383140806119424-luty/">observed</a> large numbers of geographically dispersed IP addresses delivering “hyper-volumetric attacks.” Eleven11bot has been delivering large-scale attacks ever since.</p>
<p>Volumetric DDoSes shut down services by consuming all available bandwidth either inside the targeted network or its connection to the Internet. This approach works differently than exhaustion DDoSes, which over-exert the computing resources of a server. Hypervolumetric attacks are volumetric DDoses that deliver staggering amounts of data, typically measured in the terabits per second.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/massive-botnet-that-appeared-overnight-is-delivering-record-size-ddoses/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Accepting AI-written code without understanding how it works is growing in popularity.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>To many people, coding is about precision. It's about telling a computer what to do and having the computer perform those actions exactly, precisely, and repeatedly. With the rise of AI tools like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, it's now possible for someone to describe a program in English and have the AI model translate it into working code without ever understanding how the code works. Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy recently gave this practice a name—"vibe coding"—and it's gaining traction in tech circles.</p>
<p>The technique, enabled by large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, has attracted attention for potentially lowering the barrier to entry for software creation. But questions remain about whether the approach can reliably produce code suitable for real-world applications, even as tools like <a href="https://docs.cursor.com/composer">Cursor Composer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>, and <a href="https://docs.replit.com/replitai/agent">Replit Agent</a> make the process increasingly accessible to non-programmers.</p>
<p>Instead of being about control and precision, vibe coding is all about surrendering to the flow. On February 2, Karpathy introduced the term in a post on X, writing, "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding,' where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists." He described the process in deliberately casual terms: "I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google has become so integral to online navigation that its name became a verb, meaning "to find things on the Internet." Soon, Google might just <em>tell</em> you what's on the Internet instead of showing you. The company has <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-search/">announced</a> an expansion of its AI search features, powered by Gemini 2.0. Everyone will soon see more AI Overviews at the top of the results page, but Google is also testing a more substantial change in the form of AI Mode. This version of Google won't show you the 10 blue links at all—Gemini completely takes over the results in AI Mode.</p>
<p>This marks the debut of Gemini 2.0 in Google search. Google announced the first Gemini 2.0 models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">in December 2024</a>, beginning with the streamlined Gemini 2.0 Flash. The heavier versions of Gemini 2.0 are still in testing, but Google says it has tuned AI Overviews with this model to offer help with harder questions in the areas of math, coding, and multimodal queries.</p>
<p>With this update, you will begin seeing AI Overviews on more results pages, and minors with Google accounts will see AI results for the first time. In fact, even logged out users will see AI Overviews soon. This is a big change, but it's only the start of Google's plans for AI search.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Apollo 17 mission landed on the Moon on December 11, in 1972. From that point on, literally for decades, NASA and the United States did not go back to the surface of our nearest planetary body.</p>
<p>It was not until February 22, 2024, that another American-built spacecraft made a soft landing on the Moon. This was the Nova-C <em>Odysseus</em> lander built by Intuitive Machines. It landed, toppled over, but still completed most of its scientific experiments.</p>
<p>This first successful landing on the Moon by the first privately built spacecraft ended a 51-year gap, or 18,700 days. It was a long freaking time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/after-skidding-into-the-moon-intuitive-machines-hopes-to-stick-second-landing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Brother laser printers are popular recommendations for people seeking a printer with none of the nonsense. By nonsense, we mean printers<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-ceo-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-fights-viruses/"> suddenly bricking features</a>, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">scanning</a> or printing, if users install third-party cartridges. Some printer firms outright block third-party toner and ink, despite customer blowback and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-sued-again-for-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-accused-of-monopoly/">lawsuits</a>. Brother’s laser printers have historically worked fine with non-Brother accessories. A YouTube video posted this week, though, as well as older social media posts, claim that Brother has gone to the dark side and degraded laser printer functionality with third-party cartridges. Brother tells Ars that this isn’t true.</p>
<p>On March 3, YouTuber Louis Rossman posted a video saying that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpHX_9fHNqE">Brother turns heel &amp; becomes anti-consumer printer company</a>.” The video, spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/printers/brother-accused-of-locking-down-third-party-printer-ink-cartridges-via-firmware-updates-removing-older-firmware-versions-from-support-portals">Tom’s Hardware</a>, has 163,000 views as of this writing and seems to be based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/printers/comments/s9b2eg/brother_mfc_firmware_update_nongenuine_toner_now/">a Reddit post </a>from 2022. In that post, Reddit user 20Factorial said that firmware update W1.56 caused the automatic color registration feature to stop working on his Brother MFC-3750 when using third-party cartridges.</p>
<p>“With the colors not able to be aligned, the printer is effectively non-functional,” 20Factorial said. The Redditor went on to say that when asked, a Brother customer service agent confirmed that “the printer is non-functional without genuine toner.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/brother-denies-using-firmware-updates-to-brick-printers-with-third-party-ink/">Read full article</a></p>
