              <![CDATA[<p>We're nearing the end of the year, and there are typically a flood of announcements regarding quantum computers around now, in part because some companies want to live up to promised schedules. Most of these involve evolutionary improvements on previous generations of hardware. But this year, we have something new: the first company to market with a new qubit technology.</p>
<p>The technology is called a dual-rail qubit, and it is intended to make the most common form of error trivially easy to detect in hardware, thus making error correction far more efficient. And, while tech giant Amazon has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/quantum-computing-progress-higher-temps-better-error-correction/">been experimenting with them</a>, a startup called Quantum Circuits is the first to give the public access to dual-rail qubits via a cloud service.</p>
<p>While the tech is interesting on its own, it also provides us with a window into how the field as a whole is thinking about getting error-corrected quantum computing to work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/first-commercial-dual-rail-qubit-hardware-announced/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/11/site-reputation-abuse">Updating our site reputation abuse policy</a>" is how Google, in almost wondrously opaque fashion, announced yesterday that big changes have come to some big websites, especially those that rely on their domain authority to promote lucrative third-party product recommendations.</p>
<p>If you've searched for reviews and seen results that make you ask why so many old-fashioned news sites seem to be "reviewing" products lately—especially products outside that site's expertise—that's what Google is targeting.</p>
<p>"This is a tactic where third-party content is published on a host site in an attempt to take advantage of the host's already-established ranking signals," Google's post on its Search Central blog reads. "The goal of this tactic is for the content to rank better than it could otherwise on a different site, and leads to a bad search experience for users."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/google-cracks-down-on-parasite-seo-punishing-established-publishers/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Archaeologists have discovered numerous ceramic or clay whistles at Aztec sites, dubbed "death whistles" because of their distinctive skull shapes. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-024-00157-7">new paper</a> published in the journal Communications Psychology examines the acoustical elements of the unique shrieking sounds produced by those whistles, as well as how human listeners are emotionally affected by the sounds. The findings support the hypothesis that such whistles may have been used in Aztec religious rituals or perhaps as mythological symbols.</p>
<p>Archaeologists unearthed the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_death_whistle">Aztec death whistles</a>, also known as ehecachichtlis, in 1999 while excavating the Tlatelolco site in Mexico City. They found the body of a sacrificial victim, a 20-year-old male who had been beheaded, at the base of the main stairway of a temple dedicated to the wind god Ehecatl. The skeleton was clutching two ceramic skull-shaped whistles, one in each hand, along with other artifacts. More skull whistles were subsequently found, and they've found their way into popular culture. For instance, in <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> (2021), Egon Spengler had such a whistle in his secret laboratory collection.</p>
<p>Scholars have puzzled over the purpose of the skull whistles, although given the dearth of concrete evidence, most suggestions are highly speculative. One hypothesis is that it was used in battle, with hundreds of warriors blowing their whistles simultaneously as a battle cry. Music archaeologist Arnd Adje Both has dismissed that idea, suggesting instead that the whistle's purpose was more likely tied to ceremonial or religious practices, like human sacrifice. Yet another hypothesis proposes that the whistles were intended as symbols of a deity. The skull shape, for instance, might allude to the Aztec god of the underworld, Mictlantecuhtli.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/study-why-aztec-death-whistles-sound-like-human-screams/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Windows 10's free, guaranteed security updates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/lots-of-pcs-are-poised-to-fall-off-the-windows-10-update-cliff-one-year-from-today/">stop in October 2025</a>, less than a year from now. Windows 10 users with supported PCs have been offered the Windows 11 upgrade plenty of times before. But now Microsoft is apparently making a fresh push to get users to upgrade, sending them full-screen reminders recommending they buy new computers.</p>
<p>The reminders, which users have seen within the last few days, all mention the end of Windows 10 support but otherwise seem to differ from computer to computer. My Ars colleague Kyle Orland got one focused on Windows 11's gaming features, while <a href="https://x.com/femceIs/status/1858314837845229737">posters</a> on <a href="https://x.com/RealJMcAfreak/status/1859181138746704108">X</a> (formerly Twitter) got screens that <a href="https://x.com/JustinWhang/status/1859033492367307108">emphasized</a> the ease of migrating from old PCs to new ones and other Windows 11 features. One specifically recommended <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">upgrading to a Copilot+ PC</a>, which supports a handful of extra AI features that other Windows 11 PCs don't, but other messages didn't mention Copilot+ specifically.</p>
<p>None of the messages mention upgrading to Windows 11 directly, though Kyle said his PC meets Windows 11's requirements. These messages may be intended mostly for people using older PCs that can't officially install the Windows 11 update.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-pushes-full-screen-ads-for-copilot-pcs-on-windows-10-users/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship">a draft version</a> of what is known as an "Environmental Assessment," the FAA indicated that it will grant SpaceX permission to increase the number of Starship launches in South Texas to 25 per year from the current limit of five. Additionally, the company will likely be allowed to continue increasing the size and power of the Super Heavy booster stage and Starship upper stage.</p>
<p>"FAA has concluded that the modification of SpaceX’s existing vehicle operator license for Starship/Super Heavy operations conforms to the prior environmental documentation, consistent with the data contained in the 2022 PEA, that there are no significant environmental changes, and all pertinent conditions and requirements of the prior approval have been met or will be met in the current action," the federal agency stated in its conclusion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/spacex-just-got-exactly-what-it-wanted-from-the-faa-for-texas-starship-launches/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> app is one of the most popular ways for cyclists, runners, hikers, and other distance sports enthusiasts to track their performance and grab some bragging rights. Because most athletic types will have the app installed already—and because it's hard or impossible to run two tracking apps at once—many apps use <a href="https://developers.strava.com/">Strava's API</a> as a go-between for workout data.</p>
<p>Strava emailed its more than 100 million users earlier this week to notify them about "important updates on how Strava data can be displayed, accessed, and used by third-party apps."

<p>What does this actually mean? It depends on which apps you're using. DC Rainmaker, a longtime fitness tech blogger, sees the "other users" clause as something that "immediately break[s] almost all coaching apps that have connections to Strava." If an app needs to see your Strava workout to provide insights on performance or connect you to a group, Strava's API seems to block it now. A manager at the training app Intervals <a href="https://forum.intervals.icu/t/strava-activity-visibility-update/79590">posted on the app's official forum</a> that the API change would break Intervals' ability to use Strava as its data source.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/fitness-app-strava-is-tightening-third-party-access-to-user-data/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Comcast today announced plans to spin off NBCUniversal cable TV networks such as USA, CNBC, and MSNBC into a new publicly traded company. Comcast is trying to complete the spinoff in one year, effectively unwinding part of the NBCUniversal acquisition it completed in 2011.</p>
<p>The entities in the planned spinoff generated about $7 billion of revenue in the 12 months that ended September 30, 2024, Comcast said. But cable TV channels have become less lucrative in an industry that's shifting to the streaming model, and the spinoff would let Comcast remove those assets from its earnings reports. Comcast's total revenue in the 12-month period was about $123 billion.</p>
<p>Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said in the <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/static-files/05ce0572-3978-454a-b366-45f389d1a635">Q3 earnings call</a> on October 31 that Comcast is "experiencing the effects of the transition in our video businesses and have been studying the best path forward for these assets."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/comcast-to-ditch-cable-networks-in-partial-spinoff-of-nbcuniversal-assets/">Read full article</a></p>

      Jack Black stars as Steve in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/magical-mystery-tour-warner-bros-drops-first-teaser-for-a-minecraft-movie/">first teaser</a> for <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> released in September to some decidedly mixed reactions, particularly concerning the CGI and character design and especially Jason Momoa's hair. And yes, there were many ridiculous memes. We were inclined to give it a chance based on the casting of Momoa and Jack Black. Now the full trailer has dropped, and honestly, odd design choices aside—and they are indeed odd—it looks like a perfectly acceptable fun family film and not much more, albeit very light on actual plot.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/magical-mystery-tour-warner-bros-drops-first-teaser-for-a-minecraft-movie/">previously reported</a>, once the film went into development, Jared Hess (who worked with star Jack Black on <em>Nacho Libre</em>) ended up directing. The COVID pandemic and 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike delayed things further, but filming finally wrapped earlier this year in Auckland, New Zealand—just in time for a spring 2025 theatrical release. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative… the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Game players will recognize Steve as one of the default characters in <em>Minecraft</em>. The teaser was set to The Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour" and showed our misfits encountering a fantastical Tolkien-esque landscape—only with a lot more cube-like shapes, like a pink sheep with a cubed head.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/block-zombies-are-on-the-attack-in-minecraft-movie-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An egg is an amazing thing, culinarily speaking: delicious, nutritious, and versatile. Americans eat nearly 100 billion of them every year, almost 300 per person. But eggs, while greener than other animal food sources, have a bigger environmental footprint than almost any plant food—and industrial egg production raises significant <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2018/happy-hens-happy-world">animal welfare issues</a>.</p>
<p>So food scientists, and a few companies, are trying hard to come up with ever-better plant-based egg substitutes. “We’re trying to reverse-engineer an egg,” says <a href="https://www.umass.edu/natural-sciences/about/directory/d-julian-mcclements">David Julian McClements</a>, a food scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
<p>That’s not easy, because real eggs play so many roles in the kitchen. You can use beaten eggs to bind breadcrumbs in a coating, or to hold together meatballs; you can use them to emulsify oil and water into mayonnaise, scramble them into an omelet or whip them to loft a meringue or angel food cake. An all-purpose egg substitute must do all those things acceptably well, while also yielding the familiar texture and—perhaps—flavor of real eggs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/cracking-the-recipe-for-perfect-plant-based-eggs/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The only hiccup was an abortive attempt to catch the rocket's Super Heavy booster back at the launch site in South Texas, something SpaceX achieved on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/the-key-moment-came-38-minutes-after-starship-roared-off-the-launch-pad/">previous flight on October 13</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>The Starlink waitlist is back in certain parts of the US, including several large cities on the West Coast and in Texas. The <a href="https://www.starlink.com/map">Starlink availability map</a> says the service is sold out in and around Seattle and Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; San Diego; Sacramento, California; and Austin, Texas. Neighboring cities and towns are included in the sold-out zones.</p>
<p>There are additional sold-out areas in small parts of Colorado, Montana, and North Carolina. As PCMag <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/sold-out-spacex-revives-starlink-waitlist-in-parts-of-the-us">noted yesterday</a>, the change comes about a year after Starlink added capacity and <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacexs-starlink-adds-enough-capacity-to-lift-waitlist-for-us">removed its waitlist</a> throughout the US.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in North America, there are some sold-out areas in Canada and Mexico. Across the Atlantic, Starlink is sold out in London and neighboring cities. Starlink is not yet available in most of Africa, and some of the areas where it is available are sold out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/starlink-brings-back-waitlist-in-parts-of-us-says-service-is-sold-out/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"Who up missing Musi?" a Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Musi_App/comments/1gsw582/who_up_missing_musi/">posted</a> in a community shocked by the free music streaming app's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/controversial-spotify-rival-musi-sues-apple-over-shady-youtube-takedown/">sudden removal from Apple's App Store</a> in September.</p>
<p>Apple kicked Musi out of the App Store after receiving several copyright complaints. Musi works by streaming music from YouTube—seemingly avoiding paying to license songs—and YouTube was unsurprisingly chief among those urging Apple to stop allowing the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>Musi was previously only available through the App Store. Once Musi was removed from the App Store, anyone who downloaded Musi could continue using the app uninterrupted. But if the app was ever off-loaded during an update or if the user got a new phone, there would be no way to regain access to their Musi app or their playlists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/fans-mourn-loss-of-music-streaming-app-accused-of-ripping-off-youtube/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In September, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/microsoft-performs-operations-with-multiple-error-corrected-qubits/">made an unusual combination of announcements</a>. It demonstrated progress with quantum error correction, something that will be needed for the technology to move much beyond the interesting demo phase, using hardware from a quantum computing startup called Quantinuum. At the same time, however, the company also announced that it was forming a partnership with a different startup, Atom Computing, which uses a different technology to make qubits available for computations.</p>
<p>Given that, it was probably inevitable that the folks in Redmond, Washington, would want to show that similar error correction techniques would also work with Atom Computing's hardware. It didn't take long, as the two companies are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11822">releasing a draft manuscript</a> describing their work on error correction today. The paper serves as both a good summary of where things currently stand in the world of error correction, as well as a good look at some of the distinct features of computation using neutral atoms.</p>
<h2>Atoms and errors</h2>
<p>While we have various technologies that provide a way of storing and manipulating bits of quantum information, none of them can be operated error-free. At present, errors make it difficult to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/">perform even the simplest computations</a> that are clearly beyond the capabilities of classical computers. More sophisticated algorithms would inevitably encounter an error before they could be completed, a situation that would remain true even if we could somehow improve the hardware error rates of qubits by a factor of 1,000—something we're unlikely to ever be able to do.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/how-to-fix-quantum-computing-errors-neutral-atom-edition/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last week, Niantic <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel">announced plans</a> to create an AI model for navigating the physical world using scans collected from players of its mobile games, such as <em>Pokémon Go</em>, and from users of its <a href="https://scaniverse.com/">Scaniverse</a> app, reports <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/">404 Media</a>.</p>
<p>All AI models require training data. So far, companies have collected data from websites, YouTube videos, books, audio sources, and more, but this is perhaps the first we've heard of AI training data collected through a mobile gaming app.</p>
<p>"Over the past five years, Niantic has focused on building our Visual Positioning System (VPS), which uses a single image from a phone to determine its position and orientation using a 3D map built from people scanning interesting locations in our games and Scaniverse," Niantic wrote in a company blog post.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/niantic-uses-pokemon-go-player-data-to-build-ai-navigation-system/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The world is full of feel-bad news. Here’s something to feel good about: Automatic emergency braking is one of the great car safety-tech success stories.</p>
<p>Auto-braking systems, called AEB for short, use sensors including cameras, radar, and lidar to sense when a crash is about to happen and warn drivers—then automatically apply the brakes if drivers don’t respond. It’s a handy thing to have in those vital few moments before your car careens into the back of another. One industry group <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/automakers-fulfill-autobrake-pledge-for-light-duty-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/automakers-fulfill-autobrake-pledge-for-light-duty-vehicles" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/automakers-fulfill-autobrake-pledge-for-light-duty-vehicles"}'>estimates</a> that US automakers' move to install AEB on most cars—something they did voluntarily, in cooperation with road safety advocates—will prevent 42,000 crashes and 20,000 injuries by 2025.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the streaming world, Apple has a reputation for quality, thanks to its Apple TV hardware and Apple TV+ streaming service. The latter is best associated with original shows and movies surrounded by <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-tv-wins-10-primetime-emmy-awards">award buzz</a> and critical acclaim. But despite that success, Apple's streaming service has hardly made a dent in the market at a time when interest in streaming services is bigger than ever.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/apple-tv-subscription-service-soft-launches-november-1-for-4-99mo/">launched</a> in 2019. Since then, the company has spent over $20 billion to build an impressive library of original content, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-21/apple-tries-to-rein-in-hollywood-spending-after-years-of-losses?sref=W6GJF3MS">Bloomberg</a> reported earlier this year. Yet, despite a highly regarded library of shows and movies with big names in acting and directing, Apple TV+ only garnered <a href="https://observer.com/2024/08/apple-tv-plus-streaming-war/">0.3 percent</a> of US screen viewing time in June 2024, per Nielsen.</p>
<p>In July, Bloomberg aptly underscored how minimally competitive Apple TV+ is, writing: "Apple TV+ generates less viewing in one month than Netflix does in one day."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-tv-spent-20b-on-original-content-if-only-people-actually-watched/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission's plan to investigate and potentially regulate data caps is all but dead now, after President-elect Donald Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trumps-fcc-chair-is-brendan-carr-who-wants-to-regulate-everyone-except-isps/">announcement</a> that he will promote Commissioner Brendan Carr to the chairmanship role.</p>
<p>The FCC last month <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-explores-how-broadband-data-caps-impact-competition-and-consumers">voted 3–2</a> to open a formal inquiry into how broadband data caps affect consumers and whether the commission has authority to regulate how Internet service providers impose such caps. The proceeding is continuing for now, as the FCC comment and reply comment deadlines are November 14 and December 2. You can view the docket <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(proceedings.name:(%2223-199%22))">here</a>.</p>
<p>Broadband industry lobby groups knew they would face no possibility of data-cap regulation once Trump won the election. But they submitted their comments late last week, making the case that data caps are good for customers and that the FCC has no authority to regulate them—the same arguments that Carr made when he dissented from the vote to open an inquiry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/cable-companies-and-trumps-fcc-chair-agree-data-caps-are-good-for-you/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft<em> Flight Simulator 2024</em> is out today (<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-standard-edition/9p2vgctbmm52">Xbox/PC</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/">Steam</a>), and it packs in a whole lot of simulation. It's hard to imagine topping <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/ms-flight-simulator-our-yoke-on-look-at-new-features-gorgeous-flights/5/">the 2020 version</a>, which contained the entire world, at scale, 3D modeled and able to be flown over. It had real-time weather and rather detailed physics. You could theoretically fly a helicopter back to your high school football field and land on it, like 15-year reunion royalty. What could come next?</p>

<p>A <em>lot</em>, including a world simulation that Microsoft repeatedly describes as Earth's "<a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/the-metaverse-didnt-die-it-moved-inside-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-jorg-neumann-interview/">full digital twin</a>." There are few, if any, real "reviews" up yet, given the size of the game and seemingly late access for reviewers. As such, I offer up all the notable things packed into this latest release so that those with flight sticks, patience, and a desire to get way up yonder can decide whether to take off.</p>
<p><strong>It's a whole lot smaller, at least on first install<em>.</em></strong> The <em>2020</em> version would take about 130GB on first grab (or 90GB if you <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/microsoft-flight-simulators-physical-release-spans-a-whopping-ten-dvds/">manually loaded in 10 DVDs</a>), but <em>2024</em> is "around 30" gigabytes, according to Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ceo-on-how-the-team-achieves-about-4-000-times-more-detail-than-its-predecessor">who spoke with TechRadar</a>. This should also be a major boon to those playing on Xbox, where space is more constrained.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-has-animals-ai-terrain-careers-and-flydoos/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[After claims of high-temp superconductivity were retracted, Ranga Dias lost his university job.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>University of Rochester physicist Ranga Dias made headlines with his controversial claims of high-temperature superconductivity—and made headlines again when the two papers reporting the breakthroughs were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/room-temperature-superconductor-works-at-lower-pressures/">later retracted</a> under suspicion of <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/40">scientific misconduct</a>, although Dias denied any wrongdoing. The university conducted a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/report-superconductivity-researcher-found-to-have-committed-misconduct/">formal investigation</a> over the past year and has now terminated Dias' employment, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/university-rochester-ranga-dias-superconductor-misconduct-61288727?st=oLtc1D&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">reported</a>.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>“In the past year, the university completed a fair and thorough investigation—conducted by a panel of nationally and internationally known physicists—into data reliability concerns within several retracted papers in which Dias served as a senior and corresponding author,” a spokesperson for the University of Rochester said in a statement to the WSJ, confirming his termination. “The final report concluded that he engaged in research misconduct while a faculty member here.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson declined to elaborate further on the details of his departure, and Dias did not respond to the WSJ's request for comment. Dias did not have tenure, so the final decision rested with the Board of Trustees after a recommendation from university President Sarah Mangelsdorf. Mangelsdorf had called for terminating his position in an August letter to the chair and vice chair of the Board of Trustees, so the decision should not come as a surprise. Dias' lawsuit claiming that the investigation was biased was dismissed by a judge in April.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ars has been following this story ever since Dias first burst onto the scene with reports of a high-pressure, room-temperature superconductor, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/high-pressure-superconductors-reach-room-temperature/">published in Nature</a> in 2020. Even as that paper was being retracted due to concerns about the validity of some of its data, Dias published a second paper in Nature claiming a similar breakthrough: a superconductor that works at high temperatures but somewhat lower pressures. Shortly afterward, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/nature-retracts-a-second-high-temperature-superconductor-study/">that paper was retracted as well</a>. As Ars Science Editor John Timmer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/report-superconductivity-researcher-found-to-have-committed-misconduct/">reported previously</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dias' lab was focused on high-pressure superconductivity. At extreme pressures, the orbitals where electrons hang out get distorted, which can alter the chemistry and electronic properties of materials. This can mean the formation of chemical compounds that don't exist at normal pressures, along with distinct conductivity. In a number of cases, these changes enabled superconductivity at unusually high temperatures, although still well below the freezing point of water.</p>
<p>Dias, however, supposedly found a combination of chemicals that would boost the transition to superconductivity to near room temperature, although only at extreme pressures. While the results were plausible, the details regarding how some of the data was processed to produce one of the paper's key graphs were lacking, and Dias didn't provide a clear explanation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ensuing investigation cleared Dias of misconduct for that first paper. Then came the second paper, which reported another high-temperature superconductor forming at less extreme pressures. However, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/high-temperature-superconductor-report-fails-to-replicate/">potential problems</a> soon became apparent, with many of the authors calling for its retraction, although Dias did not.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/scientist-behind-superconductivity-claims-ousted/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is announcing some new hardware today, but it’s a bit different from a typical Surface device. The <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/windows-365-link%E2%80%94the-first-cloud-pc-device-for-windows-365/4302687">Windows 365 Link</a>, which launches in April for $349, is a mini desktop PC that exists exclusively to connect to the Windows 365 cloud service rather than running Windows locally.</p>
<p>The Windows 365 Link is a plain black plastic box with a Windows logo imprinted on the top—it looks like a smaller, squarer version of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/project-volterra-review-microsofts-600-arm-pc-that-almost-doesnt-suck/">Windows Dev Kit 2023</a>, an Arm desktop that Microsoft released for developers a couple of years ago. The box has one USB-A port on the front for easy access. On the back, you get a single USB-C 3.2 port, two more USB-A ports, a full-size DisplayPort, a full-size HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a power jack.</p>
<p>Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-365-link-desktop-cloud-pc-microsoft-announcement">reports</a> that the device is fanless, uses an unspecified Intel processor, and includes 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It runs a cut-down Windows variant that exists only to connect to local peripherals and make contact with Microsoft’s Windows 365 service. When not connected to the Internet, the PC is mostly non-functional, though there is presumably some kind of basic UI available for connecting to networks and accessories locally.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-builds-a-349-mini-desktop-but-only-for-accessing-windows-in-the-cloud/">Read full article</a></p>
