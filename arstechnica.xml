                            <![CDATA[<p>As businesses around the world have shifted their digital infrastructure over the last decade from self-hosted servers to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/secret-hunting-bill-demirkapi/">cloud</a>, they’ve benefitted from the standardized, built-in security features of major cloud providers like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-secure-future-initiative/">Microsoft</a>. But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-cloud-attack-china-hackers/">disastrous consequences</a> at a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a <a href="https://dirkjanm.io/obtaining-global-admin-in-every-entra-id-tenant-with-actor-tokens/">pair of vulnerabilities</a> in Microsoft Azure’s identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts.</p>
<p>Known as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer’s user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to <a href="https://i.blackhat.com/BH-USA-25/Presentations/US-25-Mollema-Advanced-AD-to-Entra-ID-lateral-movement-techniques-Wednesday.pdf">present</a> at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>“I was just staring at my screen. I was like, ‘No, this shouldn’t really happen,’” says Mollema, who runs the Dutch cybersecurity company Outsider Security and specializes in cloud security. “It was quite bad. As bad as it gets, I would say.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/microsofts-entra-id-vulnerabilities-could-have-been-catastrophic/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Two things about the<a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-vado-sl-2-60-carbon/p/4206186?color=5356065-4206186"> Specialized Turbo Vado SL 2 6.0 Carbon</a> are hard to fathom: One is how light and lithe it feels as an e-bike, even with the battery off; the other is how hard it is to recite its full name when other riders ask you about the bike at stop lights and pit stops.</p>
<p>I’ve tested about a half-dozen e-bikes for Ars Technica. Each test period has included a ride with my regular group for about 30 miles. Nobody else in my group rides electric, so I try riding with no assist, at least part of the way. Usually I give up after a mile or two, realizing that most e-bikes are not designed for unpowered rides.</p>
<p>On the Carbon (as I’ll call it for the rest of this review), you can ride without power. At 35 pounds, it’s no gram-conscious road bike, but it feels lighter than that number implies. My daily ride is an aluminum-framed model with an internal geared hub that weighs about the same, so I might be a soft target. But it’s a remarkable thing to ride an e-bike that starts with a good unpowered ride and lets you build on that with power.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/youll-enjoy-the-specialized-turbo-vado-sl-2-6-0-carbon-even-without-assist/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Some time soon, perhaps next year, SpaceX will attempt to fly one of its enormous Starship rockets from low-Earth orbit back to its launch pad in South Texas. A successful return and catch at the launch tower would demonstrate a key capability underpinning Elon Musk's hopes for a fully reusable rocket.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, SpaceX must overcome the tyranny of geography. Unlike launches over the open ocean from Cape Canaveral, Florida, rockets departing from South Texas must follow a narrow corridor to steer clear of downrange land masses.</p>
<p>All 10 of the rocket's test flights so far have launched from Texas toward splashdowns in the Indian or Pacific Oceans. On these trajectories, the rocket never completes a full orbit around the Earth, but instead flies an arcing path through space before gravity pulls it back into the atmosphere.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/starship-will-soon-fly-over-towns-and-cities-but-will-dodge-the-biggest-ones/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The White House proposed a budget earlier this year with significant cuts for a number of agencies, including NASA. In the months since then, through the appropriations process, both the House and Senate have proposed their own budget templates. However, Congress has not passed a final budget, and the new fiscal year begins on October 1.</p>
<p>As a result of political wrangling over whether to pass a "continuing resolution" to fund the government before a final budget is passed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/19/us/trump-news?unlocked_article_code=1.nE8.9weM.l2REs_kmW7GE&amp;smid=url-share">a government shutdown</a> appears to be increasingly likely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/amid-budget-uncertainty-nasa-gets-some-good-news-use-house-funding-levels/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This week, the France-based ArianeGroup aerospace company <a href="https://press.ariane.group/europes-reusable-rocket-prototype-themis-is-installed-on-its-launch-pad">announced</a> that it had completed the integration of the Themis vehicle, a prototype rocket that will test various landing technologies, on a launch pad in Sweden. Low-altitude hop tests, a precursor for developing a rocket's first stage that can vertically land after an orbital launch, could start late this year or early next.</p>
<p>"This milestone marks the beginning of the 'combined tests,' during which the interface between Themis and the launch pad's mechanical, electrical, and fluid systems will be thoroughly trialed, with the aim of completing a test under cryogenic conditions," the company said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/after-a-very-slow-start-europes-reusable-rocket-program-shows-signs-of-life/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A two-day federal vaccine advisory meeting crammed with chaos, confusion, inept debate, bizarre comments, and a hot mic catching someone saying "you're an idiot," ended with an unexpected twist: The advisors unanimously voted—possibly unintentionally—to maintain broad access to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>In the 12–0 vote, the committee of advisors selected by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. adopted a recommendation for adults 65 and older and people aged 6 months to 64 years to get a COVID-19 vaccine based on shared clinical decision-making. After this story was published, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted the recommendation, which will broadly maintain requirements that federal and private health insurance plans cover COVID-19 vaccines at no cost. While the shared clinical decision-making is a new requirement, the CDC noted in adopting the recommendation that such decision making can be done in consultation with providers, "including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists". Most people receive COVID-19 vaccines from their local pharmacists.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the FDA limited the approvals of this year's shots, which have previously been available to anyone 6 months of age or older. The FDA's new restriction limits them to adults aged 65 and up and for people between the ages of 6 months and 64 years who have an underlying medical condition that puts them at high risk of severe COVID-19.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/bonkers-cdc-vaccine-meeting-ends-with-vote-to-keep-covid-shot-access/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since July, the state of Oklahoma has been consumed by important investigative questions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/oklahomas-new-scandal-nude-women-streamed-to-tv-during-state-board-meeting/">naked women appear on a state-owned TV set</a> during an official Board of Education meeting? Was someone in the room inadvertently streaming pornography from a personal device to the TV? Will anyone be prosecuted for what happened?</li>
<li>Were the board members who complained about the video <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/blame-the-governor-oklahomas-board-meeting-porn-scandal-goes-gonzo/">directed by the governor to "lie about me,"</a> as the state's pugnacious, hard-right Superintendent of Education asked?</li>
<li>Why was a "chiropractic table" involved in the scene? And why did the video feature, as one board member noted, a retro vibe and "a guy with a white hat, kind of a Gilligan-type hat"?</li>
</ul>
<p>We now have answers to all of those questions.</p>
<p>After a lengthy investigation by the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office and the State Bureau of Investigation, and then a lengthy consideration of their reports, the Oklahoma County District Attorney this week <a href="https://www.oklahomacounty.org/news/articleid/364/da%E2%80%99s-office-concludes-review-of-walters-39-tv-investigation">announced</a> that "there is insufficient evidence to file criminal charges."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/oklahomas-big-tv-nudes-scandal-was-a-jackie-chan-movie-on-a-samsung-streaming-service/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Less than a month ago, we looked at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/todays-game-consoles-are-historically-overpriced/">how current game console prices were historically high</a> due to price increases from all three major console makers. Today, that analysis is already a bit out of date, as Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">announced its second set of Xbox price increases this year</a> in the US.</p>
<p>The new Xbox price hikes, which will go into effect on October 3, or roughly five months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">the last set of Xbox price hikes</a>, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Xbox Series S 512GB: $400</strong> (up from $380 in May / launched at $300 in 2020)</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Series S 1TB: $450</strong> (up from $430 in May / launched at $350 in 2023)</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Series X Digital: $600</strong> (from $550 in May / launched at $450 in 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Series X: $650</strong> (up from $600 in May / launched at $500 in 2020)</li>
<li><strong>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition: $800</strong> (up from $730 in May / launched at $600 in 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">an Xbox Support post</a>, Microsoft cited the now-standard "changes in the macroeconomic environment" for the decision to move pricing yet again. "We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration," the company wrote. "Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/microsoft-raises-xbox-console-prices-for-the-second-time-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2014, University of California, Berkeley biologist Robert Dudley wrote a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drunken-Monkey-Drink-Abuse-Alcohol/dp/0520275691"><em>The Drunken Monkey: Why We Drink and Abuse Alcohol</em></a>. His controversial "<a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2014/07/01/drunken-monkeys-and-our-thirst-for-booze/">drunken monkey hypothesis</a>" proposed that the human attraction to alcohol goes back about 18 million years, to the origin of the great apes, and that social communication and sharing food evolved to better identify the presence of fruit from a distance. At the time, skeptical scientists insisted that this was unlikely because chimpanzees and other primates just don't eat fermented fruit or nectar.</p>
<p>But reports of primates doing just that have grown over the ensuing two decades. Dudley co-authored a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw1665">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances reporting the first measurements of the ethanol content of fruits favored by chimps in Ivory Coast and Uganda, finding that the chimps are consuming 14 grams of alcohol every day, the equivalent of a standard alcoholic drink in the US. After adjusting for the chimps' lower body mass, the authors concluded the chimps are consuming nearly two drinks per day.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/are-these-chimps-having-a-fruity-booze-up-in-the-wild/">we reported</a> that researchers had caught wild chimpanzees on camera engaging in what appears to be sharing fermented African breadfruit with measurable alcoholic content. That observational data was <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)00281-7">the first evidence</a> of the sharing of alcoholic foods among nonhuman great apes in the wild. They recorded 10 instances of selective fruit sharing among 17 chimps, with the animals exhibiting a marked preference for riper fruit. Between April and July 2022, the authors measured the alcohol content of the fruit with a handy portable breathalyzer and found almost all of the fallen fruit (90 percent) contained some ethanol, with the ripest containing the highest levels—the equivalent of 0.61 percent ABV (alcohol by volume).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/chimps-consume-alcohol-equivalent-of-nearly-2-drinks-a-day/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>One of the groups is Turla, which is easily one of the world’s most sophisticated advanced persistent threats (well-organized and well-funded hacking groups, many backed by nation states, that target specific adversaries for years at a time).

The group has also been known for </span><a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/powerful-highly-stealthy-linux-trojan-may-have-infected-victims-for-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unleashing stealthy Linux malware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and using </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/09/how-highly-advanced-hackers-abused-satellites-to-stay-under-the-radar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">satellite-based Internet links</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maintain the stealth of its operations</span>. The group conducts narrowly targeted attacks on high-value targets and keeps a low profile.</p>
<p>Gamaredon, meanwhile, is a separate APT known for conducting much wider-scale operations, often targeting organizations in Ukraine. Whereas Turla takes pains to fly under the radar, Gamaredon doesn’t seem to care about being detected and linked to the Russian government. Its malware generally aims to collect as much information from targets as possible over a short period of time. Both Turla and Gamaredon are widely assessed to be units of Russia’s Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the country’s chief security agency and successor of the Soviet Union’s KGB.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/two-of-the-kremlins-most-active-hack-groups-are-collaborating-eset-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was going to reject the work it had done back in 2009, when it first determined that greenhouse gas emissions posed a threat to the US public. While it laid out a number of reasons for revisiting its earlier work, one of those focused on the science: The EPA's original decision was over 15 years old, and it claimed our understanding of climate change had itself changed since then.</p>
<p>The National Academies of Science (NAS) decided that at least one aspect of that was probably right: Our understanding of the climate has changed in the last 15 years. So, it asked a group of scientists to do a quick update of our understanding of greenhouse gases, completed before public comment was closed on the EPA's plan. That report <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/29239/effects-of-human-caused-greenhouse-gas-emissions-on-us-climate-health-and-welfare">is now out</a>, and the NAS's conclusion is clear: The EPA was right in 2009, and everything we've learned since has only made it more right.</p>
<h2>The politics of emissions</h2>
<p>The EPA's endangerment finding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-trumps-epa-hopes-to-avoid-greenhouse-gas-regulations/">already had a long history</a> by the time it was completed during the Obama administration. In it, the EPA concluded that greenhouse gases pose a risk to the US and its citizens, both directly through health impacts and indirectly through economic damages. Under the Clean Air Act, that finding enabled regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and formed the foundation of plans to reduce those originating from transportation and electrical generation. All of those plans have been held up in court or abandoned before coming into effect.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/despite-congressional-threat-national-academies-releases-new-climate-report/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Carr appeared yesterday on the <a href="https://x.com/ScottJenningsKY/status/1968736369670504493">radio show</a> hosted by Scott Jennings, who describes himself as "the last man standing athwart the liberal mob." Jennings asked Carr whether <em>The View</em> and other ABC programs violate FCC rules, and made a reference to President Trump calling on NBC to cancel Fallon and Meyers.</p>
<p>"A lot of people think there are other shows on ABC that maybe run afoul of this more often than Jimmy Kimmel," Jennings said. "I'm thinking specifically of <em>The View</em>, and President Trump himself has mentioned Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers at NBC. Do you have comments on those shows, and are they doing what Kimmel did Monday night, and is it even worse on those programs in your opinion?"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/after-getting-jimmy-kimmel-suspended-fcc-chair-threatens-abcs-the-view/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Valve's Steam client is pretty widely compatible with all kinds of newer and older operating systems—that's what you do when you want as many people as possible spending their money in your store. But nothing lasts forever, and Valve does eventually end support for old software when it's time to move on. The company <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00">announced in a support note today</a> that it would be ending Steam client support for 32-bit versions of Windows on January 1, 2026.</p>
<p>"Existing Steam Client installations will continue to function for the near term on Windows 10 32-bit but will no longer receive updates of any kind including security updates," the support note reads. "Steam Support will be unable to offer users technical support for issues related to the old operating systems, and Steam will be unable to guarantee continued functionality of Steam on the unsupported operating system versions."</p>
<p>When Steam drops support for an older operating system, it's often because support is also being ended in some other underlying piece of technology that Steam uses to function, like its Chromium-based built-in browser. Valve cited "system drivers and other libraries that are not supported on 32-bit versions of Windows" as the reason for ending 32-bit Windows support.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/steam-will-drop-support-for-the-last-32-bit-windows-systems-in-january-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Summarizing complex scientific findings for a non-expert audience is one of the most important things a science journalist does from day to day. Generating summaries of complex writing has <a href="https://andrewzuo.com/how-ai-summaries-supercharged-my-reading-ee82c37c5c48">also</a> been <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-can-outperform-humans-writing-medical-summaries">frequently mentioned</a> as one of the best use cases for large language models (despite some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/australian-government-trial-finds-ai-is-much-worse-than-humans-at-summarizing/">prominent</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-are-honestly-pretty-bad/">counterexamples</a>).</p>
<p>With all that in mind, the team at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) ran an informal year-long study to determine whether ChatGPT could produce the kind of "news brief" paper summaries that its "SciPak" team routinely writes for the journal Science and <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/">services like EurekAlert</a>. These SciPak articles are designed to follow a specific and simplified format that conveys crucial information, such as the study's premise, methods, and context, to other journalists who might want to write about it.</p>
<p>Now, in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/can-chatgpt-help-science-writers">a new blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/do/10.5555/page.2385668/full/chatgpt_project_report_final.pdf">white paper</a> discussing their findings, the AAAS journalists have concluded that ChatGPT can "passably emulate the structure of a SciPak-style brief," but with prose that "tended to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity" and which "required rigorous fact-checking by SciPak writers."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/science-journalists-find-chatgpt-is-bad-at-summarizing-scientific-papers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/jef-raskins-cul-de-sac-and-the-quest-for-the-humane-computer">earlier article</a> about Macintosh project creator Jef Raskin, we looked at his quest for the humane computer, one that was efficient, consistent, useful, and above all else, respectful and adaptable to the natural frailties of humans. From Raskin's early work on the Apple Macintosh to the Canon Cat and later his unique software implementations, you were guaranteed an interface you could sit down and interact with nearly instantly and—once you'd learned some basic keystrokes and rules—one you could be rapidly productive with.</p>
<p>But no modern computer implements his designs directly, even though some are based on principles he either espoused or outright pioneered. Fortunately, with a little work and the magic of emulation, you can have your very own humane interface at home and see for yourself what computing might have been had we traveled a little further down Raskin's UI road.</p>
<h2><strong>You don’t need to feed a virtual Cat</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most straightforward of Raskin's systems to emulate is the Canon Cat. Sold by Canon as an overgrown word processor (billed as a “work processor”), it purported to be a simple editor for office work but is actually a full Motorola 68000-based computer programmable through an intentional backdoor in its own dialect of Forth. It uses a single workspace saved en masse to floppy disk that can be subdivided into multiple “documents” and jumped to quickly with key combinations, and it includes facilities for simple spreadsheets and lists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/your-very-own-humane-interface-try-jef-raskins-ideas-at-home/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>As the FTC alleged in a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-sues-live-nation-ticketmaster-engaging-illegal-ticket-resale-tactics-deceiving-artists-consumers">press release</a>, Ticketmaster's years of turning a blind eye to scalpers violated the FTC Act and the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, costing customers "billions in inflated prices and additional fees." Further, artists' efforts to keep event costs low were repeatedly frustrated by executives' greedy bid to drive Ticketmaster revenue by reaping as many additional fees as possible, the FTC alleged.</p>
<p>Rather than blocking scalping, Ticketmaster allegedly provided tech support to help so-called brokers exceed "fake" ticket limits that seemingly only applied to genuine customers buying tickets to see events.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/ticketmaster-intentionally-screwed-fans-out-of-billions-ftc-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Swedish automaker says that owners of model year 2025 EX90s—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-volvo-ex90-a-low-key-luxury-electric-suv/">like the one we tested earlier this summer</a>—are eligible for an upgrade to the electric vehicle's core computer. Specifically, the cars will get a new dual Nvidia DRIVE AGX Orin setup, which Volvo says will improve performance and reduce battery drainage, as well as enabling some features that have been TBD so far.</p>
<p>That will presumably be welcome news—the EX90 is a shining example of how the "minimal viable product" idea has infiltrated the auto industry from the tech sphere. That's because Volvo has had a heck of a time with the EX90 development, having to delay the EV <a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/polestar-3-electric-crossover-delayed-again/">not once but twice</a> in order to get a handle on the car's software.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/forget-ota-volvo-is-upgrading-the-core-computer-in-the-ex90-for-free/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The second day of a two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—a panel currently made up of federal vaccine advisors hand-selected by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/rfk-jrs-anti-vaccine-delusions-not-science-steer-cdc-now-ex-director-testifies/">anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.</a>—is off to a dramatic start, with the advisors seemingly realizing they have no idea what they're doing.</p>
<p>The inexperienced, questionably qualified group that has espoused anti-vaccine rhetoric started its second day of deliberations by reversing a vote taken the previous day on federal coverage for the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. Yesterday, the group voted to restrict access to MMRV, stripping recommendations for its use in children under age 4. While that decision was based on no new data, it passed with majority support of 8–3 (with one abstention). (For an explanation of that, see our coverage of yesterday's part of the meeting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/in-new-level-of-stupid-rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-advisors-axe-mmrv-recommendation/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>But puzzlingly, they then voted to <em>uphold </em>access and coverage of MMRV vaccines for children under age 4 if they receive free vaccines through the federal Vaccines for Children program, which covers about half of American children, mostly low-income. The discrepancy projected the idea that the alleged safety concerns that led the panel to rescind the recommendation for MMRV generally, somehow did not apply to low-income, vulnerable children. The vote also created significant confusion for VFC coverage, which typically aligns with recommendations made by the panel.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-panel-realizes-it-has-no-idea-what-its-doing-skips-vote/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.11 of the Rocket Report! We have reached the time of year when it is possible the US government will shut down its operations at the end of this month, depending on congressional action. A shutdown would have significant implications for many NASA missions, but most notably a couple of dozen in the science directorate that the White House would like to shut down. At Ars, we will be watching this issue closely in the coming days. As for Artemis II, it seems to be far enough along that a launch next February seems possible as long as any government closure does not drag on for weeks and weeks.</p>
