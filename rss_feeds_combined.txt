Toxicity is a good defense, until it isn't. Imagine, you’re a toxic toad hanging around South America. No other animals are gonna mess with you, right? After all, you’re ~toxic~! So if anyone tries to eat you, they’ll be exposed to something called a cardiotonic steroid — and may die of a heart attack. Well, unfortunately, for you, some animals have developed adaptations to these toxic steroids. Evolutionary biologist <a href="https://www.mohammadi-lab.com/people.html"target="_blank"   >Shabnam Mohammadi</a> has spent her career studying how these adaptations work — and says even humans have used these toxins to their advantage since ancient Egypt.

Barber</a> talks to Shabnam about how some predators can get away with eating toxic prey. <br><br><br><em>Curious about biology?
